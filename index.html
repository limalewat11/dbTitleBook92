The three worlds are the historical world out of which the Bible emerged and through which it came to us; the literary world (or worlds) created by the Bible itself; and the contemporary world in which we read and try to understand the Bible. </p><p> The first two worlds are likely to be strange and possibly confusing for a person entering them for the first time. The historical world involves not just the history of events to which the Bible alludes. It also encompasses the original historical context surrounding the Bible; the literary history of the Bible, which means the writing, collection, copying, passing on, and interpretation of the books through time; and the process through which the books became Scripture. The literary world is equally complex. The Bible is not so much a book as it is a library. The biblical collection contains various types of literature. </p><p> Like someone traveling in a foreign country for the first time, a student embarking on an initial study of the Bible deserves an orientation before beginning the journey. Chapter 1 can be compared to an orientation to the geography, customs, and language of a new country. We will acquaint you with a few basics about each of the three worlds into which you will be venturing. Chapter 2 is like the practical preparation a student about to go abroad receives concerning such matters as how to rent a room, get to the bathroom, use the telephone, or travel on trains. We will introduce you to the methods of analysis used in the academic study of the literary and historical worlds of the Bible and to some of the ways the Bible is interpreted in the contemporary world. </p><p> However, as is the case with travel, orientation is no substitute for the journey itself. In Chapters 3 through 15, we will guide you through the literary and historical worlds of the Bible and raise questions that stimulate you to consider the contemporary world of the various books. </p><p> We have tried hard to avoid the latest academic jargon. Where technical terms were necessary for clarity, we tried to state clearly what they mean. </p><p> In our discussions of the literary and historical worlds, our intent was to describe, not to evaluate. We hope that persons of a variety of religious backgrounds, or no religious background, will feel comfortable with our descriptions. Our purpose was to create a basis for people of various convictions about the Bible to examine its literary and historical worlds. This will, we hope, create a common ground for meaningful discussion of the contemporary world. Often, when people engage in conversation about the Bible without such a foundation, they end up talking past one another. </p><p> An Introduction to the Bible combines two of the major recent trends in biblical scholarship with more traditional concerns of biblical study. One new trend is the application of social scientific models and general history of religions models in biblical study. The second is intrinsic literary interpretation of biblical texts. We have tried to make a very clear distinction between literary inquiry and historical study. On the basis of our classroom experience, we have found that introductory students benefit from an approach that keeps the historical and literary worlds separate. It will become obvious to even the most naive reader that this dichotomy cannot and should not be pushed too far. We have also tried to make greater use of recent research in Jewish studies than is common in introductory texts, particularly in our treatment of postexilic Israel and the New Testament period. </p><p> Ideally, a student should read the entire section of the Bible along with the discussion of it. We hope that the general reader, uncoerced by the time limits of an academic schedule, will be able to do just that. At the very least, our analyses of certain materials will require students to consult those particular passages. We have very deliberately tried to write a book that introduces the Bible without becoming a substitute for reading the Bible itself. Our reason for this is quite simple. No secondary text, however excellent, can replace the experience of the primary text itself. A book about Shakespeare is no substitute for Hamlet, nor is a book about the Bible a substitute for Genesis. </p><p> We are gratified that the first four editions of An Introduction to the Bible have been well received by students and teachers alike. In this fifth edition, we have benefited from the constructive suggestions of a number, of readers, including students in our classes. Our intention has been to update and enhance our treatment of the three worlds of the Bible, without changing our basic approach. </p><p> In this edition we have made both major and minor changes. Perhaps most significant is the addition of an annotated list of movies and documentary films related to the Bible. Some on this list are major motion pictures, both the famous and the little known, from the era of silent films to the present. They reflect the concerns and cinematic style of the periods in which they were made and help illustrate the history of interpretation of the Bible in popular culture. Others on this list are among the films produced with the assistance of biblical scholars in an effort to enhance readers' understanding of the literary or historical worlds of the Bible. Many of these films are well suited for classroom use. All the movies and films are readily available on video tape for rental or purchase, through outlets included with the list. </p><p> We have also added a discussion in Chapter 16 of the role of the Bible in recent speculation about the "end time," a topic particularly relevant in an edition carrying the date 2001. In the same chapter, we have reflected on the recent controversies over the interpretation of the Bible by modern artists and the increasing presence of the Bible in widely watched television shows. </p><p> The questions for discussion and reflection at the end of chapters have also been updated with additional questions on controversial ethical issues such as homosexuality. In addition, we have drawn on recent scholarship to change and clarify the literary and historical interpretation of the Bible on scores of issues addressed in Chapters 3 through 15. We have also thoroughly updated the annotated bibliography, listing the latest and best works in biblical scholarship for readers who want to continue their study of the three worlds of the Bible beyond this introduction. </p><p> We believe that disciplined scholarship is a cumulative enterprise. The fifth edition thus incorporates a substantial number of smaller revisions aimed at keeping our treatment abreast of recent developments, and at saying things with greater precision and clarity. Once more, we express appreciation to the readers retained by Prentice Hall, other colleagues around the country, students, and other readers whose comments and criticisms have, we trust, made this fifth edition a better book than the fourth edition. </p><p> The reception accorded the first four editions has been a source of great satisfaction, not in the least because the book may have helped many people grow in their understanding of the Bible in its several worlds. Our hope is that the current edition may continue to advance that process. Acknowledgments </p><p> Any major publishing project involves the work of many persons. We would like to express our particular appreciation to the following: Wayne Spohr, Prentice Hall field editor, gave early guidance and encouragement; Ross Miller, religion and philosophy editor, offered advice and support for this fifth edition; and Joe Scordato, production editor, skillfully saw this edition through to completion. Westminster College religious studies major Radostina Todorova edited the index for this edition. </p><p> Professor Lou Silberman generously provided the foreword. Professor Robert Seelinger, Messrs. Dan Engle and Bill Wilson, and the late Rev. Arthur Young assisted with photographic illustrations. Liz Hauer, former interlibrary loan librarian at Reeves Library, Westminster College, provided access to documentary sources otherwise unavailable in central Missouri, and made major contributions to the preparation of the fourth edition index. We would like to thank Frederick H. Shively, Professor of Bible and Religion at Anderson University, for his helpful suggestions for this new edition. </p><p> The Scripture quotations in this publication are from the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible, copyright &#x2122; 1989 by the Division of Christian Education of the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.A., and used by permission.

Nor can gratitude be restricted to merely our own</p></p><h2>Loose Leaf for Business Statistics in Practice</h2><p>Bowerman 9e covers both standard business statistics and business analytics topics and provides them in a clear presentation that is organized so that business analytics topics may be used or not used.

It often seems that twentieth-century psychiatry, sect-ridden, is a Tower of Babel, as Havens once characterized it. This book is the distillation of long years of thought and practice, a bold yet modest attempt to delineate an &#x201c;integrated psychotherapy.&#x201d;</p><p>The boldness of this effort lies in its author&#x2019;s willingness to recognize the best that each school has to offer, to describe it cogently, and to integrate it into a full response to today&#x2019;s new kind of patient. Descriptive or medical psychiatry, psychoanalysis, interpersonal or behavioristic psychiatry, empathic or existential therapy-viewed in metaphors, respectively, of perceiving, thinking, managing, feeling-all have useful contributions to make to contemporary methods of treatment. But how? Havens&#x2019;s modest answer is through appropriate language, and he demonstrates exactly what he means: when to ask questions, when to direct or draw back, when to sympathize.</p><p>Practitioners now must deal with less dramatic, but more stubborn, problems of character and situation; lack of purpose, isolation, submissiveness, invasiveness, deep yet vague dissatisfaction. Some kind of human presence must be discovered in the patient, and Havens gives concrete, absorbing examples of ways of &#x201c;speaking to absence,&#x201d; of making contact. The emphasis is on verbal technique, but the underlying broad, humane intent is everywhere evident. It is no less than to transform passivity, by means of disciplined therapeutic concern, into a state of being Human.</p></p><p>Leston Havens was Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Cambridge Hospital.A basic grammar of empathy--a sort of 'Strunk and White' for psychotherapists...Obviously, the author of this quite lively and quite lovely text is interested and skilled in providing genuine verbal havens rather than easy intellectualizations."

Engaging and accessible, this book is useful to undergraduate students with a wide range of backgrounds and career goals. The exposition immediately begins with statistics, presenting concepts and results from probability along the way. Hypothesis testing is introduced very early, and the motivation for several probability distributions comes from p-value computations. Pruim develops the students&#39; practical statistical reasoning through explicit examples and through numerical and graphical summaries of data that allow intuitive inferences before introducing the formal machinery. The topics have been selected to reflect the current practice in statistics, where computation is an indispensible tool. In this vein, the statistical computing environment $\textsf{R}$ is used throughout the text and is integral to the exposition. Attention is paid to developing students&#39; mathematical and computational skills as well as their statistical reasoning. Linear models, such as regression and ANOVA, are treated with explicit reference to the underlying linear algebra, which is motivated geometrically.

Therapeutic change, in the view of Fred J. Hanna, hinges on the presence of seven precursors of change: hope, awareness, a sense of the necessity of change, the willingness to experience anxiety or difficulty, the willingness to confront issues, the exertion of the will or effort, and the presence of social support. The presence of these precursors bodes well for a client no matter what the therapist&#39;s theoretical orientation. Their absence creates roadblocks to therapeutic change no matter how skilled the therapist, how potent the theory, or how close the relationship.</p><p></p><h2>Carson Dellosa Common Core Math 4 Today Workbook&#x2014;Reproducible 3rd Grade Math Workbook, Place Value, Geometry, Algebra Practice, Classroom or Homeschool Curriculum (96 pgs) (Common Core 4 Today)</h2><p>Build a foundation and focus on what matters most for math readiness with Common Core Math 4 Today: Daily Skill Practice for third grade.

One of the foremost Yiddish poets of the day, he used his journey as the basis for two highly autobiographical novellas (translated as <i>The Glatstein Chronicles</i>) in which he intertwines childhood memories with observations of growing anti-Semitism in Europe.</p><p>Glatstein&#x2019;s accounts &#x201c;stretch like a tightrope across a chasm,&#x201d; writes preeminent Yiddish scholar Ruth Wisse in the Introduction. In Book One, &#x201c;Homeward Bound,&#x201d; the narrator, Yash, recounts his voyage to his birthplace in Poland and the array of international travelers he meets along the way. Book Two, &#x201c;Homecoming at Twilight,&#x201d; resumes after his mother&#x2019;s funeral and ends with Yash&#x2019;s impending return to the United States, a Jew with an American passport who recognizes the ominous history he is traversing.</p><p><i>The Glatstein Chronicles </i>is at once insightful reportage of the year after Hitler came to power, reflection by a leading intellectual on contemporary culture and events, and the closest thing we have to a memoir by the boy from Lublin, Poland, who became one of the finest poets of the twentieth century.</p></p><p><b>Jacob Glatstein</b> arrived in America in 1914 and went on to publish twelve volumes of poetry, seven collections of essays and literary criticism, a wartime novel for teenagers, and the autobiographical novellas translated as <i>The Glatstein Chronicles</i>. <b>Ruth Wisse </b>is the Martin Peretz Professor of Yiddish Literature and Professor of Comparative Literature at Harvard University. The late <b>Norbert Guterman</b> completed the first English translation of Book Two of <i>The Glatstein Chronicles</i> in 1962. <b>Maier Deshell</b> translated Book One. He is former editor of the Jewish Publication Society and translated (with Margaret Birstein) Yehoshua Perle&#x2019;s <i>Everyday Jews: Scenes from a Vanished Life</i>, also for the New Yiddish Library.Unlike in today&#x2019;s coming-to-America stories, in the old immigration classics, there was never much about going both ways, but this autobiographical novel about a Yiddish writer&#x2019;s return to his birthplace in Lublin, Poland, to see his dying mother in 1934, 20 years after he left for New York, tells a rare story of an immigrant who left and returned, always a stranger. When the narrator, Yash (the author&#x2019;s nickname), arrives in New York in 1914, he gets a cold welcome; his uncle, who sent the ticket, cannot leave the sweatshop. On the boat back to Poland from New York, Yash is a Jew with an American passport, exchanging lots of anecdotes and memories with his fellow travelers. In Europe, he witnesses Hitler Youth and hears about Jews in trouble. And at his mother&#x2019;s funeral, he feels the resentment toward those who left and deserted the family. All the bits and pieces in the story are distracting, but the narrative confusion parallels the disjointed nature of searching for home, a journey Isaac Singer called bereft of adventure and romance. --Hazel Rochman</p><h2>Science Fiction and Philosophy: From Time Travel to Superintelligence</h2><p>A timely volume that uses science fiction as a springboard to meaningful philosophical discussions, especially at points of contact between science fiction and new scientific developments. <ul> <li>Raises questions and examines timely themes concerning the nature of the mind, time travel, artificial intelligence, neural enhancement, free will, the nature of persons, transhumanism, virtual reality, and neuroethics</li> <li>Draws on a broad range of books, films and television series, including <i>The Matrix, Star Trek, Blade Runner, Frankenstein, Brave New World, The Time Machine,</i> and <i>Back to the Future</i></li> <li>Considers&nbsp;the classic philosophical puzzles that appeal to the general reader, while also exploring new topics of interest to the more seasoned academic</li> </ul></p><p>Science fiction is more than mere entertainment.

A perfect complement to his historic translation of <em>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl</em> reanimates another beloved Medieval English masterpiece thought to be by the same anonymous author and housed in the same original fourteenth-century manuscript. Honoring the rhythms and alliterative music of the original, Armitage&#x2019;s virtuosic translation describes a man mourning the loss of his Pearl&#x2015;something that has &#x201c;slipped away.&#x201d; What follows is a tense, fascinating, and tender dialogue weaving through the throes of grief toward divine redemption. Intricate and endlessly connected, Armitage&#x2019;s lyrical translation is a circular and perfected whole, much like the pearl itself.</p><p>Simon Armitage is the award-winning poet and translator of both Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and The Death of King Arthur, as well as several works of poetry, prose, and drama.

Seeing the body as an adversary, these patterns can lead many people to become withdrawn or isolated. Ann Saffi Biasetti&#x2019;s powerful holistic approach to liberating people from disordered eating focuses on growing self-compassion and embodiment. This insight, informed by yoga and mindfulness meditation, views the body not just as something to be healed or restored but as a source of great wisdom and knowledge. <br><br> Dr. Biasetti offers yoga-based movement, body-awareness practices, meditations, and journaling exercises to help release long-held habits of self-criticism and perfectionism.

You can feel it when you are in her presence and you can feel it in the pages of this warm, supportive, and encouraging book. Drawing upon the latest science related to self-compassion and its role in well-being, wellness and health, Ann weaves this knowledge and wisdom into a practical guide to finding a new relationship between you and your body: the most important (and often the most conflicted) relationship a human being can have. Ann teaches how having a warm and encouraging relationship with ourselves can then allow us to make change, not because we aren&#x2019;t good enough as we are, but because we long for something better.

Creon hesitates and his fate is sealed. </p><p>Sophocles' great tragic play dramatises the clash between the family and the city and, with high poetry and deep tragedy, presents an irreconcilable but equally balanced conflict. Sophoclean heroine Antigone has become a cultural archetype, the symbol of personal integrity and an icon of political freedom, whilst her coprotagonist Creon can be interpreted as either a civic saviour or a ruthless tyrant. </p><p>This translation by Don Taylor, accurate yet poetic, was made for a BBC TV production of the Theban Plays in 1986, which he directed.</p></p><p><p>In his long life, Sophocles (born ca. 496 B.C., died after 413) wrote more than one hundred plays.

These Excel and MINITAB tutorials give users access to step-by-step instructions and screen shots for using the software to perform the statistical techniques presented in the chapter. Real-world applications and critical thinking skills are emphasized throughout that will allow readers to realize greater success in the workplace. <b> </b> <b>Reorganized content</b> &#x2014; Rank tests are integrated throughout, dot plots added in Chapter 2, cumulative binomial tables added to appendix, section on the normal approximation to the binomial distribution added to Chapter 6, and goodness-of-fit test of multinomial category probabilities added to Chapter 8. <b> </b> For use as an introduction to statistics reference with a background in college algebra. </p></p><p><p><b>Educational Philosophy</b></p> <p> In our many years of teaching introductory statistics courses at the University of South Florida and Baruch College, we have continually searched for ways to improve the teaching of these courses. Our vision for teaching these introductory statistics courses has been shaped by active participation in a series of professional conferences as well as the reality of serving a diverse group of students at a large university. Over the years, our vision has come to include these principles: </p> <ul> <li>Students need a frame of reference when learning about a subject, especially one that is not their major. That frame of reference for introductory statistics students should be the various areas in which statistics can be applied, including business, biology, education, engineering, mathematics, political science, psychology, and sociology. Each statistical topic needs to be related to at least one of these areas of application.</li> <li>Virtually all the students taking introductory statistics courses are majoring in areas other than statistics. Introductory courses should focus on underlying principles that are important for non-statistics majors.</li> <li>The use of spreadsheet and/or statistical software should be integrated into all aspects of the introductory statistics course. The reality that exists in the workplace is that spreadsheet software (and sometimes statistical software) is most typically available on the desktop. Our teaching approach needs to recognize this reality and make our courses more consistent with the workplace environment.</li> <li>Textbooks that use software must provide instructions at a depth that maximizes the student's ability to use the software with a minimum risk of failure.</li> <li>The focus in teaching each topic should be on (1) the application of the topic to a specific problem, (2) the interpretation of results, (3) the presentation of assumptions, (4) the evaluation of the assumptions, and (5) the discussion of what should be done if the assumptions are violated. These points are particularly important in regression and forecasting and in hypothesis testing. Although the illustration of some computations is inevitable, the focus on computations should be minimized.</li> <li>Both classroom examples and homework exercises should relate to actual or realistic data as much as possible. Students should be encouraged to look beyond the statistical analysis of data to the interpretation of results in an applied context, preferably through the use of case studies.</li> </ul> <p> This philosophy led us to develop <i>Practical Statistics by Example Using Microsoft</i> � <i>Excel and MINITAB</i> �. Designed as an introductory text in statistics for students with a background in college algebra, our text contains the following features that distinguish it from the many other statistics texts available. </p> <p><b>"By Example" Introduction of Concepts</b></p> <p> Each new idea is introduced and illustrated by real data-based examples taken from a wide variety of disciplines and sources. These examples demonstrate how to solve various types of statistical problems encountered in the real world. We believe that students better understand definitions, generalizations, and concepts <i>after</i> seeing a real application. Each example is set off for easy identification and contains a full, detailed solution to the problem. </p> H3&gt;Microsoft Excel and MINITAB as Tools for Statistical Analysis<p></p> <p> The spreadsheet application Microsoft Excel and the statistical software MINITAB are integrated throughout the entire text. Many texts published and revised in the past twenty years have incorporated the use of popular statistical software packages such as SAS, SPSS, and MINITAB. Few, however, have successfully integrated Excel. With the increasing functionality and power of worksheet applications, virtually all kinds of statistical analyses taught in the introductory course can now be supported by Excel and the statistics add-in provided with this text (PHStat2). In addition to its possible use in a statistics course, students </p><p><b>Emphasis on Critical Thinking and Interpretation of Computer Output</b></p> <p> Both Excel- and MINITAB-generated graphs and output accompany every statistical technique presented, allowing instructors to focus on the statistical analysis of data and the interpretation of the results rather than the calculations required to obtain the results. Free from memorizing formulas and performing hand calculations, students are encouraged to develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to realize greater success in the workplace. Examples on hand calculations are provided for those instructors who desire flexibility in teaching the course. </p> <p><b>Tutorials on Using Microsoft Excel and MINITAB</b></p> <p> For the novice, <i>The Excel Primer</i> provides basic instruction on using Windows and Microsoft Excel and <i>The MINITAB Primer</i> provides basic instruction on using MINITAB. <i>Excel</i> and <i>MINITAB Tutorials</i> appear at the end of pertinent chapters and give step-by-step instructions and screen shots for using the applications to perform the statistical techniques presented in the chapter. </p> <p> All data sets that are stored in the Excel and MINITAB directories on the CD that accompanies the text are identified with a CD-ROM icon and the name is provided. </p> <p><b>Statistics Add-In for Microsoft Excel: PHStat</b></p> <p> The CD-ROM that accompanies the text also includes PHStat2, the latest version of PHStat, Prentice Hall's statistical add-in for Microsoft Excel for Windows. PHStat2 minimizes the work associated with setting up statistical solutions in Microsoft Excel by automating the creation of worksheets and charts. PHStat2, in combination with Excels Data Analysis Too1PAK add-in and table and chart wizards, allows users to perform statistical analyses on virtually all topics covered in an introductory statistics course. (Compared to its predecessor, PHStat2 contains a number of new or enhanced procedures and now includes a full help system for easy reference. For more information about PHStat2, see Appendix E.) </p> <p><b>"Statistics in the Real World" Application in Each Chapter</b></p> <p> Each chapter opens with a real-world application and data set to motivate the material presented in the chapter and to provide a real-life context for learning statistics. The "Statistics in the Real World" problem is revisited throughout the chapter in relevant sections. At the end of each of these sections, the data set is analyzed using the method presented in the section and relevant conclusions are drawn from the analysis. </p> <p><b>Built-In Study Guide</b></p> <p> The following features are incorporated throughout the text to help students learn and retain new ideas: </p> <ul> <li> <i>Self-test questions</i> appear immediately after important ideas have been introduced to test the student's comprehension of the concept and to help develop good study habits. Answers given in the Appendix allow students to check their work.</li> <li> <i>Summary boxes</i> are set off to provide step-by-step instructions for the statistical techniques presented.</li> <li> <i>Side notes</i> provide additional explanations of key ideas adjacent to where the concept is first referenced.</li> <li>Each chapter ends with a list of <i>Key Terms, Formulas,</i> and <i>Symbols</i> with page references that guide the student back to the text in order to review the element in context.</li> <li>Each chapter begins with a set of <i>Objectives.</i> Students can determine if the objectives have been met by answering a series of <i>Checking Your Understanding</i> questions at the end of the chapter.</li> </ul> <p><b>Topical Coverage at the Introductory Level</b></p> <p> This text includes all the topics covered in a basic introductory statistics course, including data collection (Chapter 1), descriptive statistics (Chapters 2 and 3), probability and probability distributions (Chapters 4 - 6), confidence intervals (Chapters 7 and 9), hypothesis tests (Chapters 8 and 9), regression (Chapter 10), and analysis of variance (Chapter 11). A minimal amount of probability is presented, allowing more time for instructors to teach statistical inference (Chapters 7-11). Unique to this introductory text is a section on proper graphical presentation (Section 2.6), which promotes E. R. Tufte's principles of graphical excellence. </p> <p><b>New to This Edition</b></p> <p> The second edition of <i>Practical Statistics by Example Using Microsoft</i> � <i>Excel and MINITAB</i> � includes a number of additions and enhancements: </p> <ul> <li>Chapter 1&#x2014;<i>Collecting Internet Data.</i> Section 1.4 now includes a discussion and example on obtaining data available via the Internet.</li> <li>Chapter 2&#x2014;<i>Dot Plots.</i> We've added dot plots as another method for graphing quantitative data in Section 2.3.</li> <li>Chapter 5&#x2014;<i>Binomial Tables.</i> In addition to obtaining binomial probabilities using Excel and MINITAB, we demonstrate how to use cumulative binomial tables.</li> <li>Chapter 6&#x2014;<i>Normal Approximation to the Binomial.</i> A new section (Section 6.4) has been added on using the normal distribution to approximate binomial probabilities.</li> <li>Chapter 8&#x2014;<i>Testing Category Probabilities for a Qualitative Variable.</i> The chi-square goodness of fit test for category probabilities of a single qualitative variable is now included in Section 8.9.</li> <li>Chapters 9-11&#x2014;<i>Integration of Nonparametric Methods.</i> The following nonparametric tests (in Chapter 12 of the previous edition) are now integrated as optional sections in the chapters with their parametric alternatives: Wilcoxon rank sum test (Section 9.7), Wilcoxon signed ranks test (Section 9.8), Spearman's rank correlation test (Section 10.13), and Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test (Section 11.8).</li> <li> <i>PHStat2</i>&#x2014;The latest version of the PHStat statistics add-in now includes additional features relating to tables and charts, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and regression, along with a help system.</li> <li> <i>MINITAB Tutorials</i>&#x2014;The second edition of the text now includes MINITAB tutorials in addition to Excel tutorials at the end of each chapter.</li> </ul> <p><b>Supplements for the Instructor</b></p> <p> Each element in the package has been accuracy-checked to ensure clarity, adherence to the approaches presented in the main text, and freedom from computational, typographical, and statistical errors. </p> <p> <b>Instructor's Solutions Manual</b> <br> (by Mark Dummeldinger) (ISBN 0-13-041587-1).

Over the centuries, Americans have read and written their way into a political culture of ink and type.</p><br><p> Part civics primer, part cultural history, <i>The Story of America</i> excavates the origins of everything from the paper ballot and the Constitution to the I.O.U. and the dictionary. Along the way it presents fresh readings of Benjamin Franklin's <i>Way to Wealth</i>, Thomas Paine's <i>Common Sense</i>, "The Raven" by Edgar Allan Poe, and "Paul Revere's Ride" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, as well as histories of lesser-known genres, including biographies of presidents, novels of immigrants, and accounts of the Depression.</p><br><p> From past to present, Lepore argues, Americans have wrestled with the idea of democracy by telling stories. In this thoughtful and provocative book, Lepore offers at once a history of origin stories and a meditation on storytelling itself.</p></p><p><p>"As both a Jeremiah and a troubadour, Jill Lepore has one of the most distinctive voices in American literary life. So skilled in the art of the essay, she has a sense of narrative that is breathtaking. She tells resounding, surprising stories about real people forging American roots and development, but always through a deeply documented history. Both subtly and explosively, Lepore brings the power of history right into your lap and makes you shudder at just how deeply tangled past and present really are."<b>--David W. Blight, author of <i>American Oracle: The Civil War in the Civil Rights Era</i></b></p><p>"Jill Lepore is one of America's most interesting scholars--a distinguished historian and a brilliant essayist. This prolific collection of articles and essays is a remarkable body of work that moves from early America to our present, contentious age."<b>--Alan Brinkley, author of <i>The Publisher: Henry Luce and His American Century</i></b></p><p>"Jill Lepore is one of our finest historians of the battle over the story called 'America,' which, as she says, is constantly being fought over and over. In this stunning collection of essays, Lepore makes the case that the rise of democracy is bound up with the history of its reading and writing. That history is conflicted, ragged, and contradictory but, in Lepore's capable hands, as gripping and compelling as a novel."<b>--Cathy N. Davidson, Duke University</b></p><p>"Concise, clear, vivid, witty, insightful, and rich in turns of phrase. More than any other historian I know, Lepore cares about good writing and has a talent for making sophisticated ideas accessible to a broad readership."<b>--Alan Taylor, author of <i>The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels, and Indian Allies</i></b></p><p>"Jill Lepore's storytelling power is on full display here. As much literary exercises as historical inquiries, these essays are compact, highly readable, and often written from an unexpected angle. Combining a lightness of touch with the authority of a historian who knows her field inside out, Lepore moves effortlessly through the length of American history."<b>--Wai Chee Dimock, Yale University</b></p><b>Jill Lepore</b> is the David Woods Kemper '41 Professor of American History at Harvard University and a staff writer at the <i>New Yorker</i>.

Only one of them killed a man. This is the story of Ray Chapman of the Cleveland Indians, a popular player struck in the head and killed in August 1920 by a pitch thrown by Carl Mays of the New York Yankees. Was it, as most baseball observers thought at the time, a tragic but unavoidable accident? Mike Sowell&#39;s book investigates the incident and probes deep into the backgrounds of the players involved and the events that led to one of baseball&#39;s darkest moments.</p><p>Mike Sowell teaches journalism at Oklahoma State University. He has also written <i>One Pitch Away: The Players' Stories of the 1986 League Championships and World Series</i>. He lives in Stillwater, Oklahoma, outside of Oklahoma City.Sowell thoroughly explored that horrifying incident in his 1989 book and provided fascinating historical context.

A railroad buff since a child, he took strange pleasure in his work as a POW on the Burma-Siam Railroad, which was later the subject of the film Bridge Over the River Kwai. When his captors discovered his detailed drawings of the railway, he was suspected as a spy and tortured for years. Fifty years later he discovered that the interpreter during his tortures was still alive. The two arranged a meeting and Lomax forgave him. Here is the exciting, moving and truthful account.Winner of the 1996 NCR Book Award <br>A naive young man, a radio enthusiast and radio buff, was caught up in the fall of the British Empire at Singapore in 1942. He was put to work on the Railway of Death -- the Japanese line from Thailand and Burma. The most disastrous engineering project in history, it killed 250,000 Allied prisoners and Thai labourers. Lomax helped to build a radio so that he and his comrades could follow news of the war. The radio was discovered and he was brutally tortured. One of his tormentors was a young Japanese interpreter; Lomax never forgot him. Despite an outwardly successful life, Lomax was emotionally ruined by his experiences and could never share them with anyone. Almost fifty years after the war, his life was changed by the discovery that his interrogator, the Japanese interpreter, was still alive. This is the story of a tragic life and a transformed old age.</p><h2>House on the Strand</h2><p>When Dick Young&#39;s friend, Professor Magnus Lane, offers him an escape from his troubles in the form of a new drug, Dick finds himself transported to fourteenth-century Cornwall. There, in the manor of Tywardreath, the domain of Sir Henry Champerhoune, he witnesses intrigue, adultery and murder.The more time Dick spends consumed in the past, the more he withdraws from the modern world. With each dose of the drug, his body and mind become addicted to this otherworld, and his attempts to change history bring terror to the present and put his own life in jeopardy.</p><p>Daphne du Maurier (1907-89) was born in London, the daughter of the famous actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier and granddaughter of George du Maurier, the author and artist. In 1931 her first novel, The Loving Spirit, was published. A biography of her father and three other novels followed, but it was the novel Rebecca that launched her into the literary stratosphere and made her one of the most popular authors of her day. In 1932, du Maurier married Major Frederick Browning, with whom she had three children.Many of du Maurier&#39;s bestselling novels and short stories were adapted into award-winning films, including Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s The Birds and Nicolas Roeg&#39;s Don&#39;t Look Now. In 1969 du Maurier was awarded a DBE. She lived most of her life in Cornwall, the setting for many of her books.Michael Maloney's tense reading, punctuated by musical interludes, at first gives this production the feel of a soap opera. But his intensity energizes this bleak, chilly novel of a man unhappy in his own life and obsessed with the past, which he can visit, or view, through an experimental time-travel drug. In a novel filled with unsympathetic characters, Maloney makes protagonist Dick seem more sympathetic than he would otherwise be. He indicates various characters skillfully through small shifts of voice; his American accent for Dick's wife is flawless. No one could make this novel fun; Maloney makes it involving. A printed insert on the story's background is helpful but contains many spoilers.

Born in Chicago, he attended Northwestern University, and upon graduation went to work for the Associated Press, beginning a lifelong career in journalism that would include long periods at the Chicago Tribune and Advertising Age. While at the Tribune, Goldsborough began writing mysteries in the voice of Rex Stout, the creator of iconic sleuths Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin. Goldsborough&#x2019;s first novel starring Wolfe, Murder in E Minor (1986), was met with acclaim both from critics and devoted fans, winning a Nero Award from the Wolfe Pack. Six more novels followed, including Death on Deadline (1987) and Fade to Black (1990). In 2005, Goldsborough published Three Strikes You&#x2019;re Dead, the first in an original series starring Chicago Tribune reporter Snap Malek. His most recent novel is Terror at the Fair (2011).Devotees of the late Rex Stout's bestsellers will be pleasantly surprised by Goldsborough's first story about Nero Wolfe. Related by the elephantine genius's faithful assistant Archie Goodwin, this mystery starts when Maria Radovich asks him to intercede for her with Wolfe. She's worried over threats against her great-uncle Milan Stevens, controversial new director of the New York Symphony. Since Stevens, ne Mikos Stefanovic, had saved the detective's life years earlier in Montenegro, Wolfe agrees to take the case. Before he can act, however, someone stabs the musician fatally in his apartment. The police arrest Jerry Milner, a violinist with the orchestra and Maria's fiance, but Wolfe demolishes the evidence against him. While his boss remains sedentary, Archie obeys orders to go looking for information about other suspects: the victims's sponsor who regrets his choice of director; musicians whom the maestro had publicly insulted; the glamorous society woman who had been his frequent companion. As always, Wolfe solves the puzzle without moving from the famous brownstone on 37th St. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Boy A: Movie Tie-in Edition</h2><p><p>&#x201c;A shocker of a first novel . . . told with extraordinary restraint.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Jonathan] Trigell masterfully builds sympathy for Jack.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;A modern-day immorality tale about the attempted rehabilitation of a child implicated in murder . . . delivered with a horrific sense of foreboding.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Arena</i></p><p>&#x201c;A fine and moving debut novel . . . compulsively readable . . . a rare treat.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Independent</i></p><p><i>A is for Apple.

There they find a device that lets them see into the past and defeat the aliens responsible for the planet's demise. Originally written in the early 1960s, both books needed and got a certain amount of technological and political updating, so that, for instance, the Russian opponents aren't Communist but newfangled Russian imperialists.

When its owner, a traitorous earl, saw his defeat coming at Edward's hands during the War of the Roses, he gave the relic to a trusted ally, Brandon. Now Brandon has died under mysterious circumstances and his companions are missing. The king also requests that Kate Swindon, physician and herbalist, examine Brandon's body and report on his cause of death. At the same time, Colin and Kate are being pursued by Colin's vengeful former comrades. The long arm of deceit and treason reaches from very close to the throne as treachery and intrigue cause corpses to be piled all over the English countryside near Canterbury. The witty team of doctor and soldier who first met in A Shrine of Murders (St. Martin, 1993) recite lines from Chaucer to one another as they solve the case and try to avoid the stalker. The story's swift pace keeps Kate moving rapidly between doctoring and detecting in this colorful historical mystery.<br><i>Mary T. Gerrity, Queen Anne School Library, Upper Marlboro, MD</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.In this atmospheric mystery set in 15th-century England, physician Kathryn Swinbrooke, introduced in last year's A Shrine of Murders , investigates murder in the bloody aftermath of the War of the Roses. Before Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, is killed in battle, he gives his squire Robert Brandon a famed jewel, the Eye of God, to take to the monks in Canterbury to arrange masses for his soul. Brandon is captured and dies in prison but no jewel is recorded among his possessions. Edward IV, of the victorious House of York, sets Colum Murtagh, his special commissioner in Canterbury, to find the stone, which had originally belonged to his father, Richard of York; the king asks Kathryn to investigate the manner of Brandon's death. As Colum's interrogations continue, more murders occur. Katherine's knowledge of both anatomy and human nature combine with a clue found in Chaucer's "Pardoner's Tale" to lead Colum to the resolution in this promising new pseudonymous series from medieval mystery writer P.

Freese speaks to dozens of major corporations annually.Use People's Curiosity to Make the Sale<br><br>Excerpted from Secrets of Question-Based Selling by Thomas Freese � 2000<br><br>The newly hired salesperson, trying to rationalize his lack of production during the first month on the job, explains to his boss, "Sir, I can lead the 'horses' to water, but I can't always make 'em drink."<br><br>"Make 'em drink?" the sales manager sputters. "Making customers drink is not your job. Your job is to make them thirsty!"<br><br>The sales manager in this anecdote makes an interesting point. It's not a salesperson's job to make people buy. Rather, the salesperson's function is to uncover new opportunities, and then pique the prospect's interest, so they will want to know more about the products and services being offered.<br><br>In Question Based Selling, we want prospective customers to become curious. We want them to ask questions, and we want them to be "thirsty" for more information about the value we provide. But this requires a change in strategy. Rather than launching right into a litany of features and benefits, in an attempt to pique your prospect's interest, QBS recommends piquing the prospect's interest first in order to create new opportunities to uncover needs and present solutions. <br><br>If you want to engage new prospects in productive sales conversation, you essentially have two choices. You can be aggressive and try to force your way in, or you can make prospects curious enough to want more information about the value you provide-so they will invite you in. Not surprisingly, most of us would rather be invited in than to try and use brute force. <br><br>The Conversational Layering model (from chapter 6) shows us that curiosity is the key that unlocks the rest of the sales process. If a prospective buyer is not the least bit interested in who you are, or what you can do for them, then you will not get their time or attention. Fortunately, the opposite is true. As prospective buyers become more and more curious about how you can offer value, it becomes much easier to create new opportunities to sell. This is actually good news for salespeople because it simplifies the sales process. It also puts you in control of your own destiny. In other words, if you can make prospects curious, then you will have many more opportunities to establish credibility, build relationships, uncover needs, present solutions, and secure the commitments necessary to move forward with a sale. <br><br>Now, the question is, what makes people curious?<br><br>The Easiest Way to Make Someone Curious<br>There are lots of ways to make people curious. You can make someone curious by saying something that piques their interest. You can also leverage curiosity with provocative voice-mail messages or by sending intriguing emails. We will analyze each of these as the chapter unfolds, but for starters, let's begin by talking about the easiest way to pique someone's curiosity. <br><br>Making people curious doesn't have to be difficult. In fact, the easiest way to pique someone's curiosity is to simply say, "Guess what?" Virtually everyone you say this to will stop what they're doing and say, "What?" That was easy. Now, at least for the moment, you have their complete and undivided attention. <br><br>You can produce a similar result by saying, "Can I ask you a question?" That's another easy yes. Test it out for yourself. Simply walk up to the next person you see and say, "Can I ask you a question?" This question usually stops people in their tracks because they instinctively begin to wonder what you are about to ask. <br><br>Both of these questions are designed to create what we call a mini-forum for engagement. We said earlier that you must first have a prospect's time and attention in order to position the value of your product or service. In the Conversational Layering Model, we characterized this as having a forum for selling. But sometimes (especially in sales) you have to walk before you can run. <br><br>At the very beginning of the sales process, sellers haven't yet earned the right to ask for several hours of the prospect's time. It's more likely that we are just trying to get through the first few minutes of the call. By asking for smaller commitments, you make it easier for prospects to engage-at least initially. Then, what you do to pique the prospect's interest further, will ultimately determine whether the sales process moves forward or stalls. <br><br>This is important because the larger sale is usually an accumulation of smaller successes; and if you can consistently secure the prospect's attention, you will create many more opportunities to expand your sales conversations. For example, I don't start probing for needs without first saying, "Can I ask a couple specifics about your current _________ environment?" Likewise, I rarely offer a suggestion without asking, "Would you like to hear some feedback?" We use this technique throughout QBS to garner the prospect's time and attention, which is much more effective than just trying to bully your way in. <br><br>I would like to add that leveraging curiosity in the strategic sales process is not a manipulation strategy. Quite the contrary. Asking questions to make sure it's OK to proceed is not only good manners, it demonstrates that you are sensitive to the prospect's situation and you are also very respectful of their needs. Let me ask you, do customers appreciate it when someone is respectful of their time and space?<br><br>Voice Mail: Friend or Foe?<br>For many sellers, voice mail is the enemy. It's the gatekeeper that stands in the way of a salesperson talking directly with the prospect they are trying to reach. As we said in chapter 1, thousands of voice-mail messages are being left every day, but only a small fraction of these calls are ever returned. <br><br>Prospects, on the other hand, think voice mail is terrific. Automated messaging systems have given them the flexibility to be out of the office and away from their desks, yet they can still receive important messages. Voice mail also enables key decision makers to screen incoming calls, so they can focus on their business rather than be interrupted by constant solicitations. <br><br>Some sales trainers teach salespeople to hang up when they get a prospect's voice mail and not leave a message. Instead, they would rather you keep calling and calling until the person you're trying to reach actually picks up the phone. The busier the prospect, or the more averse they are to receiving sales calls, the less productive this strategy is, however. <br><br>Other sales trainers suggest that you should leave increasingly forceful voice-mail messages so prospects will feel a sense of obligation to call you back. The problem is, these messages often fall victim to Charlie Brown's Teacher Syndrome (chapter 6), because salespeople end up leaving the same old worn-out messages over and over. <br><br>In QBS, we want to differentiate ourselves from the typical sales caller, but not just for the sake of being different. We want to differentiate ourselves for the sake of being more effective. This means leveraging curiosity on voice-mail messages to get more call backs and, ultimately, engage more prospects in productive sales conversation. <br><br>Once I learned how to make people curious, voice mail became a terrific asset and a good friend. In fact, one of the secrets to my success in selling was that I had a very high engagement rate-95 percent of the voice-mail messages I left generated a return call. Let me say that again: 95 percent of the people I called, called me back. Why did they call back? It's because when I left a voicemail message, I didn't think about features, benefits, solutions, needs, or relationships. I only thought about one thing-what could I say that will cause this person to become curious enough to call me back. <br><br>Leveraging curiosity does require some thought and creativity. There are no magical scripts that will guarantee your success on each and every call. But there are many ways that you can pique someone's interest (when leaving voice mail) in order to engage potential customers in a mutually productive sales conversation. Here are a few ideas to get you started. <br><br>A Question That Only You Can Answer <br>Salespeople aren't always calling new prospects. Sometimes we're calling people where there is already a relationship-for example, existing customers, business partners, or other contacts in our industry. Calling someone who is familiar can be much easier than making cold calls, but you still have to compete with everything else that's vying for that person's time and attention. So rather than leave the same old generic-sounding message, you might leave a voice-mail message that says: <br><br>Salesperson: "Hi Susan, this is (your name and affiliation). I was hoping to catch you for a minute because I have a question...that only you can answer. If you could please call me back, I'll be in my office this afternoon until around 4:30 P.M." <br><br>Will Susan return the call? If your voice-mail message makes her curious, she will. This technique is particularly effective because it's personal without being offensive. It also conveys a certain sense of urgency. After all, any question that "only you" can answer must be important. It's also very easy to implement. Before you dial the phone, just think of a question that only your prospect can answer. Examples include: "Susan, how do you feel about ______?" or "What is your opinion on ______?" These are questions that only Susan can answer (by definition) because you are soliciting her thoughts, feelings, and/or opinions. By the way, most people (that you have some familiarity with) love to give their opinions, and they will likely be flattered that you asked. <br><br>Something Made Me Think of You <br>Using a similar approach, you can make existing contacts curious, so they will respond to your call, by leaving a voice-mail message that says, "Hi Richard, I decided to pick up the telephone and call...because something happened earlier today that made me think of you. If you get a minute, I'll be in the office until around 6:15 P.M. this evening. My telephone number is (770) 840-7640." If you were Richard, would you return the call? Most people will, especially if they receive the message before 6:15 P.M. They would want to know what had happened that made you think of them. Note: when they do return your call, be ready with a story or anecdote that will lead the conversation into your business reason for calling. <br></p><h2>Living at the Edge: Explorers, Exploiters, and Settlers of the Grand Canyon Region</h2><p>A comprehensive look at the pioneer history of the Grand Canyon region, from its earliest residents to the creation of the national park at the end of the pioneer era (circa 1920).

Her fiction has won national awards from the Faulkner Society and the National Endowment for the Arts. She teaches creative writing in Clinton, New York (where she lives with her husband and two sons), and Montolieu, France.A pleasantly unpolemical, if plodding, novel about a 21st-century abortionist who's haunted by the memory of her political-activist sister. It's the year 2026, and the world is a Gingrichian vision of high-tech gadgetry and conservative social values. Abortion is illegal and birth control scarce--as much from fear of declining birth rates among the white middle class as from Christian moral precepts. In this repressive but nominally democratic America, Phoebe has a day job as a computer debugger; secretly, she performs ``misconceptions,'' as illicit abortions are called. No abortion- rights crusader, Phoebe refers to her work as ``killing babies'' and continues mainly to carry on the legacy of her spirited older sister, Marie, a ``misconceiver'' who died in jail. Phoebe's brother and mother are also dead, and her father suffers from advanced Alzheimer's, so when the suicide of a 12-year-old incest victim throws her into a moral crisis, she turns to her widowed sister-in-law, Roxanne, for a place to lie low for a while. But while visiting Roxanne in California, Phoebe is moved by the plight of Roxanne's teenage daughter, Christel, who's facing an unwanted pregnancy. With the help of Roxanne's fianc&#x201a; Arthur, a doctor, Phoebe performs an abortion on her niece--and Phoebe and Arthur begin an affair. Arriving back home in Utica, Phoebe is immediately arrested and must figure out who has betrayed her. Was it Arthur, one of the friends or colleagues in whom she's confided, or perhaps a traitor in the underground community of abortion providers? Then a fellow prisoner helps her escape, and Phoebe has to consider how far she wants to go in service of Marie's cause. Ferriss (Against Gravity, 1996, etc.) worthily acknowledges the complexities of the abortion debate, and her dystopia, if not wildly original, is thoroughly imagined--yet ultimately the tale remains constrained by its narrow focus and muddled plot. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Her work has appeared in numerous magazines and journals, including The New York Times Magazine, The Washington Post Magazine, Allure and The Rumpus. She lives in Portland, Oregon.<b><br>From the INTRODUCTION</b> by Steve Almond<br>&nbsp;<br> <i>I Was Sugar Once</i>: Lessons in Radical Empathy<br><br> &nbsp;<br> Long ago, before there was a Sugar, there was Stephen Elliott. He had this idea for a website, which sounds pretty awful, I admit, except that his idea was really to build an online community around literature, called <i>The Rumpus</i>. Being a writer himself, and therefore impoverished, Stephen prevailed upon his likewise impoverished writer friends to help.<br> &nbsp;<br> And we, his friends, all said yes, because we love Stephen and because (if I may speak for the group) we were all desperate for a noble-seeming distraction. My contribution was an advice column, which I suggested we call Dear Sugar Butt, after the endearment Stephen and I had taken to using in our email correspondence. I will not belabor the goofy homoeroticism that would lead to such an endearment. It will be enough to note that Dear Sugar Butt was shortened, mercifully, to Dear Sugar.<br> &nbsp;<br> Handing yourself a job as an advice columnist is a pretty arrogant thing to do, which is par for my particular course. But I justified it by supposing that I could create a different sort of advice column, both irreverent and brutally honest. The design flaw was that I conceived of Sugar as a persona, a woman with a troubled past and a slightly reckless tongue.<br> &nbsp;<br> And while there were moments when she felt real to me, when I could feel myself locking into the pain of my correspondents, more often I faked it, making do with wit where my heart failed me. After a year of dashing off columns, I quit.<br> &nbsp;<br> And that might have been the end of Sugar had I not, around this time, come across a nonfiction piece by Cheryl Strayed. I knew Cheryl as the author of a gorgeous and wrenching novel called Torch. But reading this essay, a searing recollection of infidelity and mourning, filled me with a tingling hunch. I wrote to ask if she wanted to take over as Sugar.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was an insane request. Like me, Cheryl had two small kids at home, a mountain of debt, and no regular academic gig. The last thing she needed was an online advice column for which she would be paid nothing. Of course, I did have an ace in the hole: Cheryl had written the one and only fan letter I&#x2019;d received as Sugar.<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> The column that launched Sugar as a phenomenon was writ- ten in response to what would have been, for anyone else, a throwaway letter. Dear Sugar, wrote a presumably young man. <i>WTF, WTF, WTF? I&#x2019;m asking this question as it applies to everything every day</i>. Cheryl&#x2019;s reply began as follows:<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Dear WTF,<br> &nbsp;<br> My father&#x2019;s father made me jack him off when I was three and four and five. I wasn&#x2019;t any good at it. My hands were too small and I couldn&#x2019;t get the rhythm right and I didn&#x2019;t understand what I was doing. I only knew I didn&#x2019;t want to do it. Knew that it made me feel miserable and anxious in a way so sickeningly particular that I can feel that same particular sickness rising this very minute in my throat.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was an absolutely unprecedented moment. Advice columnists, after all, adhere to an unspoken code: focus on the letter writer, dispense the necessary bromides, make it all seem bearable. Disclosing your own sexual assault is not part of the code.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Cheryl wasn&#x2019;t just trying to shock some callow kid into greater compassion. She was announcing the nature of her mission as Sugar. Inexplicable sorrows await all of us. That was her essential point. Life isn&#x2019;t some narcissistic game you play online. It all matters&#x2014;every sin, every regret, every affliction. As proof, she offered an account of her own struggle to reckon with a cruelty she&#x2019;d absorbed before she was old enough even to understand it. Ask better questions, sweet pea, she concluded, with great gentleness. The fuck is your life. Answer it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Like a lot of folks, I read the piece with tears in my eyes&#x2014; which is how one reads Sugar. This wasn&#x2019;t some pro forma kibitzer, sifting through a stack of modern anxieties. She was a real human being laying herself bare, fearlessly, that we might come to understand the nature of our own predicaments.<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> I happen to believe that America is dying of loneliness, that we, as a people, have bought into the false dream of convenience, and turned away from a deep engagement with our internal lives&#x2014;those fountains of inconvenient feeling&#x2014;and toward the frantic enticements of what our friends in the Greed Business call the Free Market.<br> &nbsp;<br> We&#x2019;re hurtling through time and space and information faster and faster, seeking that network connection. But at the same time we&#x2019;re falling away from our families and our neighbors and ourselves. We ego-surf and update our status and brush up on which celebrities are ruining themselves, and how. But the cure won&#x2019;t stick.<br> &nbsp;<br> And this, I think, is why Sugar has become so important to so many people. Because she&#x2019;s offering something almost unheard of in our culture: radical empathy. People come to her in real pain and she ministers to them, by telling stories about her own life, the particular ways in which she&#x2019;s felt thwarted and lost, and how she got found again. She is able to transmute the raw material of the self-help aisle into genuine literature.<br> &nbsp;<br> I think here of the response she offered a man wrecked by his son&#x2019;s death, who asked her how he might become human again. &#x201c;The strange and painful truth is that I&#x2019;m a better person because I lost my mom young,&#x201d; she wrote. &#x201c;When you say you experience my writing as sacred what you are touching is the divine place within me that is my mother. Sugar is the temple I built in my obliterated place.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In this sense, Tiny Beautiful Things can be read as a kind of ad hoc memoir. But it&#x2019;s a memoir with an agenda. With great patience, and eloquence, she assures her readers that within the chaos of our shame and disappointment and rage there is meaning, and within that meaning is the possibility of rescue.<br> &nbsp;<br> ***</p><h2>Speed-Reading at the Keyboard, Vol. 3</h2><p>A complete course which helps any keyboard player master the art of sight-reading.

But now that he&#39;s been captured, she seems to be the only one able to hear his every thought, feel his every emotion, share his dreams.

They have also both written for television.<p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> "Please, Max," a voice begged. "You can't die on me now...not after you finally agreed to be more than 'just friends.'" </p><p> The voice sounded so far away. Like it was coming from the end of a long tunnel. Max Evans turned in a slow circle. He didn't see anyone. He didn't see <b>anything</b>, anything but the light. The pure white light. </p><p> "The communication crystals are in your hand," the voice told him. "You have to connect to the collective consciousness, Max. Do it now! You don't have much time!" </p><p> The collective consciousness. That sounded familiar. Sort of. The voice sounded familiar, too. But he couldn't remember from where. </p><p> Max sat down, then stretched out on his back. The light was so awesome. It actually had patterns in it, like white snowflakes against white sheets or something. He just wanted to lie there and watch the bright snowflakes coming down. </p><p> New voices joined the first one. He felt as if he'd heard them before, too, a long time ago. All the voices joined together, pleading with him to make the connection. Join the consciousness. Live. </p><p> Max tried to tune them out. The snowflakes were something that should be looked at in silence. He didn't know how he knew that, but he did. </p><p> "Max, no! Don't die! You can't die. If you really love me, you'll stay with me," the first voice cried. </p><p> Liz. Liz Ortecho. The name appeared in big amber letters in his brain. How could he have forgotten the sound of Liz's voice, the voice of the girl he loved? </p><p> Now he recognized the other voices, too. His sister, Isabel's. And the voices of his friends Alex Manes and Maria DeLuca. He peered into the white light. Where were they? </p><p> Where was <b>he?</b> </p><p> "Can't see...," he mumbled. He swallowed hard, trying to unglue his tongue from the roof of his mouth. "Where...where are you?" </p><p> "We're right here, Max. We're all here with you," Liz exclaimed. "Stay with us. Stay with me." </p><p> And without thinking about it, without deciding to do it, Max was up on his feet. Flying through the brilliant white light, the snowflakes whizzing past him faster and faster until they were nothing but blurs. </p><p> Then the light began to fade, and he could see he was speeding down a tunnel. His bed stood at the end, so far away it looked as tiny as a box of matches. Liz, Isabel, Alex, and Maria, small as dolls, gathered close around it, staring down at Max's body. </p><p> My body, Max thought. How can that be my body? </p><p> He was rushing straight toward the body on the bed until he was so close, he could see the droplets of sweat on the body's forehead, see the tiny splotches of blood on the body's lips. Then he slammed into the body -- <b>his</b> body -- and melded with it. He could feel the sheets crumpled beneath him. The pillow soft under his head. The air rasping in his lungs as he breathed. Liz's hand holding his. </p><p> "Focus on the crystals, Max. Connect to the collective consciousness," Liz urged. </p><p> The collective consciousness. This time the words brought back a rush of memory. He was going through his <b>akino,</b> his life change ceremony. If he didn't connect with the collective consciousness of his home planet, he would die. And he'd thought that was what was going to happen because he couldn't make the connection without the communication crystals stored on his parents' spaceship. The ship kept in a secret compound, surrounded by guards with machine guns. </p><p> He turned his head slightly, locking eyes with Isabel. "You found the ship?" he asked his sister, his voice cracking. But he already knew the answer. He held the communication crystals in his hand. That was the proof. "Where's Michael?" he croaked out. "Ray?" They'd gone into the compound with Isabel, so they should be here, too. </p><p> "Not now," Isabel answered, her voice tight. "Make the connection, Max. Hurry!" </p><p> Liz pressed Max's fingers more tightly around the crystals. He closed his eyes, and he reached out with his mind. Instantly he felt, not a touch exactly, but the sensation of someone standing very close to him, close enough that the edges of their auras blended. It wasn't Liz, Isabel, Alex, or Maria. He knew the feel of their auras almost as well as he knew his own, and the aura touching his was unfamiliar...but somehow comforting. </p><p> Another <b>presence</b> moved close, its aura touching Max's, too, mixing with his, mixing with the aura of the first presence, until a single shared aura formed around the three of them. He felt none of the brain-shredding pain he'd experienced when he tried to connect to the collective consciousness without the crystals. This time connecting was like stepping into a tropical ocean, with the warm salty water surrounding him, making his body light and buoyant, rocking him with gentle waves. </p><p> The ocean was made of auras. Not just the two blended with his, but thousands of them. Hundreds of thousands of them. Maybe more. Maybe millions. Max stretched out and out with his mind and could find no end. </p><p> He heard a single word from the two presences closest to him. The word wasn't spoken in English. It wasn't actually spoken at all. It was as if the essence of the word washed over his brain, needing no translation. <b>Son.</b> </p><p> <b>Son.</b> The word swept through Max again and again, filling him with emotions not his own. Joy and grief. Pride and longing. Love. </p><p> My parents. No. It can't be. </p><p> Yes, they answered without words. Yes, son. </p><p> But his parents...his parents were dead. They died when their spaceship crashed in the desert -- the so-called Roswell Incident. They had been dead more than forty years when Max and Isabel broke free of their incubation pods. </p><p> So that meant he wasn't only connecting with all those who lived on his home planet. He was connecting to the spirits of the dead as well. Max felt his eyes start to burn. This just blew him away. His parents. He was actually communicating with his parents. He never thought...never even hoped... </p><p> An image flashed through his mind. Two shining beings staring down at the incubation pod Max shared with his sister. He felt a rush of the beings' giddy, practically giggly excitement, their eagerness to see their children born. But they never had. </p><p> Max felt a stab of grief from his parents, a grief he was also experiencing himself. Then music began to play, humming, almost vibrating music, more like the sound a finger makes rubbing around the rim of a crystal glass than any musical instrument Max knew. It was a lullaby. The lullaby his mother's mother had sung for her, the one his mother had planned to sing to her children. This knowledge was somehow passed along to Max as he listened. </p><p> A new presence touched Max's aura, and the image of two moons, half covered by acid green clouds, filled his mind. Seconds later another new presence touched him, and a sweet, tangy liquid poured down his throat. It tasted exactly right, the way no earth food ever did. Max was always having to mix mouthwash into his orange soda or pickle juice into his milk to get them to taste good to him. But this -- more of the liquid filled his mouth -- this was perfect just the way it was. </p><p> Again a new presence touched Max, and a lemony, peppery smell enveloped him. With the smell came the knowledge that the scent belonged to a kind of berry that could be used to treat digestive problems. </p><p> They're each sharing a little scrap of information about my planet, Max thought. This was too cool. </p><p> Another presence touched him. He recognized the aura instantly. It belonged to Ray Iburg, Max's boss at the UFO museum, and the only adult who had survived the crash. "Ray!" Max cried, not sure if he was actually using his vocal cords to shout the name or just his brain. "Ray, you saved my life. You, and Michael, and Isabel! I never thought you guys would make it back with the communication crystals in time! I don't even know what to say, how to thank you. All I know is we're going to have to have a serious party -- maybe at the museum after we close tomorrow night." </p><p> An image filled Max's brain, an image of him and Ray in the museum, both dressed in the goofy sequined Elvis outfits Ray had had made, both laughing so hard, their faces were all scrunched up. </p><p> Ray was showing him one of the great times they'd had together. But the emotion Max was getting off Ray didn't match the picture. He wasn't getting anything close to laughter. There was relief, and sadness, and something that felt like a good-bye. </p><p> Another presence touched Max, breaking his connection with Ray. The image of the control panel of a spaceship replaced the image of Max and Ray. Knowledge about the mechanics of the panel filled his brain. Max tried to shove it away. He needed to connect with Ray again. What was going on with him? Why was there all that sadness pulsing off him? </p><p> "Ray!" Max called. "Where are you?" </p><p> Another new presence touched Max, and the sound of a low clacking surrounded him. With the sound came information -- the clacking was a warning that a poisonous insect was nearby. </p><p> Max didn't care about that right now. "Ray!" he shouted. But there was no answer. Something was wrong. Something was very wrong. </p><p> Max opened his fingers, allowing the communication crystals to fall free of his hand. He could still feel the presences around him. Another one touched him, showing him the image of a being changing shape as it stepped out of a spaceship. </p><p> "Stop! Just stop!" Max yelled. He sat up in bed and immediately turned to his sister. "Isabel, tell me what happened to Ray," he demanded. </p><p> "Are you okay?" Liz cried. She pressed her palm against his forehead. "You look so much better. Are you -- " </p><p> Max didn't take his eyes off Isabel. "I'm fine," he interrupted. "I just need to know what happened to Ray." </p><p> The devastated expression on Isabel's face told him everything. But he still needed to hear it. </p><p> "He's dead. Sheriff Valenti shot him," Isabel answered. "Ray was trying to save me, and Valenti shot him." Tears welled up in her blue eyes, and she wiped them away with a vicious sweep of her hand. </p><p> Liz sat down on the bed and pulled Max close to her. He could tell from her breathing that she was trying not to cry. "I knew," Max whispered against her shoulder, the wool of her sweater making tiny scratches across his cheek. "I knew. That's why he was saying good-bye." </p><p> "What about Michael?" Maria asked, her voice quaking. </p><p> Max jerked up his head. Michael? </p><p> "The last time I saw him, he was fighting off a couple of guards," Isabel answered. Max could tell she was working hard to keep the emotion out of her voice. Michael Guerin was like a second brother to her. And to Max. </p><p> "And you left him there?" Maria cried, her voice climbing into a shriek. </p><p> "That's right. I left him there." Isabel's words came out hard and clipped. "I knew there was a chance he would survive on his own. But there was no way Max was going to live if I didn't get back here with the crystals." </p><p> Max felt the acid in his stomach start to bubble. Isabel had sacrificed Michael for him. If she'd stayed and helped him take out the guards, would Michael -- </p><p> "He could still be alive," Liz said, pulling him away from this thoughts. "We've got to get out there right now. We've got to -- " </p><p> "No," Alex interrupted. "They'll be expecting us. We'd never make it in." </p><p> "You're saying we should just leave him there?" Max demanded. There was no way that was happening. </p><p> "No, we won't leave him there," Alex shot back, obviously peeved. "But we have to make a plan, let a little time go by so we can catch them when they're not standing at the front door with an arsenal." </p><p> "I don't care what the rest of you do. I'm going to the compound. Now." Maria turned toward the door. </p><p> "Wait. I'm going with you," Max answered. </p><p> Alex moved to block the door. "Actually, neither of you is going anywhere." He turned to Isabel. "You said Michael was fighting off a couple of guards. That means they weren't using their machine guns on him, right?" </p><p> Machine guns, Max thought. Is that what Valenti used on Ray? A machine gun? Max tried not to imagine Ray's body jerking while the bullets hit. </p><p> "They were using..." Isabel swallowed. "I think they were cattle prods. Something that gave an electrical charge." </p><p> "Okay, so they must not want him dead," Alex continued. "Best-case scenario, he got away and is heading back here. Worst-case scenario, he's being held prisoner. But alive. We need to give him a little time to show up. If he doesn't, we'll make plans, and we'll get him out." </p><p> "Alex is right," Isabel said. "We go in now, it's over for all of us. If we wait until they're not expecting us, we at least have a shot." </p><p> "All right. I hate the thought of leaving Michael in there. But I think we have to do it," Liz agreed. </p><p> Alex glanced from Maria to Max. "You two, promise that you won't do anything stupid. No one goes to the compound before we come up with a strategy to get us all back out alive." </p><p> "Yeah, yeah. Okay. But we better come up with this brilliant strategy real soon," Max said. </p><p> Maria hesitated. "I'm with Max," she finally said. Then she shoved past Alex and bolted. </p><p> "Do you all mind just leaving me alone for a while? I'm really wiped out," Max said. It wasn't true. Connecting to the collective consciousness had left him feeling strong and invigorated. But he needed time to think, to process. </p><p> Ray was dead. Michael was captured. And it was all Max's fault. They wouldn't have been in the compound if he hadn't gotten sick. </p><p> He couldn't do anything about Ray. But he could do something about Michael. Yeah, he might wait a few days. But he would free Michael. </p><p> No matter what it took. </p><p> Copyright � 2000 by Pocket Books</p></p><h2>Plants and Animals of the Pacific Northwest: An Illustrated Guide to the Natural History of Western Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia</h2><p><p>In the lowlands of the Pacific Northwest, from southern Oregon to British Columbia, the plant and animal life is rich and vast. Previously anyone interested in identifying and learning about the fauna and flora has had to consult a different book for each life form: a tree book for the Pacific yew, a wildflower guide for Indian pipe, and some other reference for garter snakes.</p><p>In this guidebook, Eugene Kozloff has compile a general natural history of the region, including about 450 species of plants and animals. In order to be as thorough as possible and still preserve the portability of the book, the author has included those species that are fairly common, widely distributed, and can be easily identified by nonspecialists.</p><p>This book is substantially complete for trees, shrubs, vines, major wildflowers, ferns and fern allies, and amphibians and reptiles. A few especially abundant or conspicuous mammals are discussed, and there are helpful suggestions for beginning the study of birds of the region. Also included is a wide selection of mosses, liverworts, and lichens, as well as the more common snails, slugs, millipedes, centipedes, and certain other invertebrates.</p></p><p><p>Nearly every species discussed is presented visually in one of the 321 excellent color photographs and organization of the plants and animals are the book&#x2019;s greatest assets; they provide the nonspecialist with an easy means of species identification....

Or a parrot, dolphin, or elephant?&nbsp; Do they experience thoughts that are similar to ours, or have feelings of grief and love? These are tough questions, but scientists are answering them. They know that ants teach, earthworms make decisions, and that rats love to be tickled. They&#x2019;ve discovered that dogs have thousand-word vocabularies, that parrots and dolphins have names, and that birds practice their songs in their sleep. But how do scientists know these things?<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animal Wise</i> takes us on a dazzling odyssey into the inner world of animals from ants to wolves, and among the pioneering researchers who are leading the way into once-forbidden territory: the animal mind.&nbsp;With&nbsp;thirty years of experience covering the sciences, Morell uses her formidable gifts as a story-teller to transport us to field sites and laboratories around the world, introducing us to animal-cognition scientists and their surprisingly intelligent and sensitive subjects.&nbsp; She explores how this rapidly evolving, controversial field has only recently overturned old notions about why animals behave as they do.&nbsp; She probes the moral and ethical dilemmas&nbsp; of recognizing that even &#x201c;lesser animals&#x201d;&nbsp; have cognitive abilities such as&nbsp; memory, feelings, personality, and self-awareness&#x2013;traits that many in the twentieth century felt were unique&nbsp; to human beings.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By standing behaviorism on its head, Morell brings the world of nature brilliantly alive in a nuanced, deeply felt appreciation of the human-animal bond, and she shares her admiration for the men and women who have simultaneously chipped away at what we think makes us distinctive while offering a glimpse of where our own abilities come from.</p><p><b>Virginia Morell</b> is a prolific contributor to <i>National Geographic,</i> <i>Science</i>, and <i>Smithsonian</i>, among other publications.

Those enshrined in its annals are men and women whose ideas, accomplishments, or personalities have dominated, endured, and most important of all, found champions. John F. Kennedy's <i>Profiles in Courage</i>, Giorgio Vasari's <i>Lives of the Artists</i>, and Samuel Johnson's <i>Lives of the Poets</i> are classic celebrations of the greatest, the brightest, the eternally constellated.<br><br>Paul Collins' <i>Banvard's Folly</i> is a different kind of book. Here are thirteen unforgettable portraits of forgotten people: men and women who might have claimed their share of renown but who, whether from ill timing, skullduggery, monomania, the tinge of madness, or plain bad luck-or perhaps some combination of them all-leapt straight from life into thankless obscurity. Among their number are scientists, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, and adventurers, from across the centuries and around the world. They hold in common the silenced aftermath of failure, the name that rings no bells.<br><br>Collins brings them back to glorious life. John Banvard was an artist whose colossal panoramic canvasses (one behemoth depiction of the entire eastern shore of the Mississippi River was simply known as "The Three Mile Painting") made him the richest and most famous artist of his day. . . before he decided to go head to head with P. T. Barnum. Ren� Blondot was a distinguished French physicist whose celebrated discovery of a new form of radiation, called the N-Ray, went terribly awry. At the tender age of seventeen, William Henry Ireland signed "William Shakespeare" to a book and launched a short but meteoric career as a forger of undiscovered works by the Bard -- until he pushed his luck too far. John Symmes, a hero of the War of 1812, nearly succeeded in convincing Congress to fund an expedition to the North Pole, where he intended to prove his theory that the earth was hollow and ripe for exploitation; his quixotic quest counted Jules Verne and Edgar Allan Poe among its greatest admirers.<br><br>Collins' love for what he calls the "forgotten ephemera of genius" give his portraits of these figures and the other nine men and women in <i>Banvard's Folly</i> sympathetic depth and poignant relevance. Their effect is not to make us sneer or p0revel in schadenfreude; here are no cautionary tales. Rather, here are brief introductions-acts of excavation and reclamation-to people whom history may have forgotten, but whom now we cannot.<br></p><p>Sometimes things don't exactly work out. Schemes collapse, experiments fail, luck runs out, or times and tastes simply change. It's a clich� that history is written by winners--but it's important to remember that it's usually written <i>about</i> winners, too. Paul Collins changes that, highlighting the failures, the frauds, and the forgotten in <i>Banvard's Folly</i>. <p> Most of Collins's starts were famous--or infamous--in their own time. For example, William Henry Ireland forged dozens of documents "by Shakespeare," including the play <i>Vortigern</i>, but was found out by his overenthusiastic use of "Ye Olde Sppellingge." (Oddly enough, William's father refused to believe his son was responsible even after William confessed; William was widely held to have been too stupid to have written such impressive forgeries.) Then there's respected scientist Ren� Blondlot, who fooled himself--as well as most of the scientific community--into believing he had discovered a remarkable new form of radiation, which he named N-Rays. In reality, they were only an optical trick of peripheral vision. The book's namesake, John Banvard, amassed a fortune from his celebrated "Three Mile Painting"--a huge panoramic rendering of the Mississippi River--and then lost his fortune in an unsuccessful attempt to compete with master advertiser and showman P.T. Barnum. </p><p> Collins describes these and several other "nobodies and once-were-somebodies" in chatty, often tongue-in-cheek prose (in recounting the story of Jean Fran�ois Sudre and his musical language, Collins notes "obsessive fans who hear already secret messages in music would not do their mental stability any favors by learning Solresol"). He also includes a handy "for further reading" section, should you have the desire to learn more about, for example, Symmes's theory of concentric spheres, grape propagation, or the medical benefits of blue glass. Funny, thought provoking, and sometimes poignant, <i>Banvard's Folly</i> helps to rescue these lost souls from the ash heap of history. Very highly recommended. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p><b>Paul Collins</b> writes for M<i>cSweeneys Quarterly</i>, and his work has also appeared in<i> Lingua Franca</i> and <i>eCompany Now</i>.

BOMC &amp; QPB.</p><p>Lord Byron as a vampire? That notion may not explain the aberrant behavior of the much-revered Romantic poet, but it definitely provides a racy foundation for Holland's engaging and sophisticated debut novel. The story begins in London in the present, as lovely young Rebecca Carville petitions her lawyer for the keys to the family crypt, where she hopes to find the sole existing copy of Byron's memoirs. Instead, she finds Byron himself, who proceeds to tell her the story of how he became a vampire during his journey to Greece. The first half of Byron's account remains within the conventions of the horror genre, as the great poet desperately fights the efforts of the powerful Greek vardoulacha, who eventually drains his blood. Once Byron begins to explore his new nature, however, Holland embarks on a remarkable literary journey, touching on how the poet's burden might have affected his relationships with the women in his life as well as his problematic dealings with Shelley. Other subplots recall the early Anne Rice novels, particularly the sections in which Byron tries to unite the vampires and help the Greeks in their revolt against the Turks. But the most compelling portions of the book probe the links between blood and family that surface when Byron discovers that he must take the life of a relative in order to maintain his youthful beauty. Both the period detail and the biographical material are exquisitely rendered, and the shocking revelation that brings the story full circle and places Rebecca Carville in extreme peril makes for a nice surprise ending. With this striking, highly original debut, Holland offers a valuable addition to the vampire legend. 75,000 first printing; $100,000 ad/promo; BOMC and QPB selection; simultaneous Simon &amp; Schuster Audio. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.The modern figure of the vampire--aristocratically domineering, supersensitive, accursed, fatally attractive, simultaneously loving and hating life--is based so much on the Romantic literary figure of the damned hero that is called, after its most famous popularizer, <i>Byronic</i>, that this contemporary gothic shocker in which Byron himself is a vampire had to be written sooner or later. Holland has very little to do creatively; he just projects the incidents, attitudes, and methods of vampire yarns, from <i>Dracula</i> to <i>Interview with the Vampire</i>, upon the tenor and themes of Byron's writings (which are liberally excerpted for epigraphs to this book's chapters), and--voila!--he has a thoroughly marketable piece of pop lit that has already fared so well in Britain that Pocket Books is giving it a big-splash launching in America. It may well duplicate its British success here, for it has plenty of the elements--mucking about in the mountainous, gloomy Balkans; S&amp;M-tinged seductions both hetero-and homosexual; shambling, rotting zombies doing vampiric masters' biddings; blood-and-gore^-laden violence; world-weary posturing by the bloodsucking heroes; genuine historical characters in its cast--common in the current spate of vampire romances. But Holland's style is more like Poe's as rewritten by some hack historical novelist than Byron's. Those who crave real literary distinction from the vampire subgenre should be directed to Perucho's <i>Natural History</i> (U.S. ed., 1989) on the high end of the cultural brow, to King's <i>Salem's Lot</i> on the low. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis (Thorndike Press Large Print Basic Series)</h2><p>A #1 New York Times Bestseller Hillbilly Elegy is a passionate and personal analysis of a culture in crisis &#x2015; that of white working-class Americans. The decline of this group, a demographic of our country that has been slowly disintegrating over forty years, has been reported on with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside.</p><p><p>From a former marine and Yale Law School graduate, a probing look at the struggles of America&#x2019;s white working class through the author&#x2019;s own story of growing up in a poor Rust Belt town.</p><p><em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> is a passionate and personal analysis of a culture in crisis&#x2014;that of poor, white Americans. The disintegration of this group, a process that has been slowly occurring now for over forty years, has been reported with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. In <em>HillbillyElegy</em>, J.D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hanging around your neck.</p><p>The Vance family story began with hope in postwar America. J.D.&#x2019;s grandparents were &#x201c;dirt poor and in love&#x201d; and moved north from Kentucky&#x2019;s Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually one of their grandchildren would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of success in achieving generational upward mobility. But as the family saga of <em>Hillbilly Elegy </em>plays out, we learn that J.D.&#x2019;s grandparents, aunt, uncle, sister, and, most of all, his mother struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, never fully escaping the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. With piercing honesty, Vance shows how he himself still carries around the demons of his chaotic family history.</p><p>A deeply moving memoir, with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, <em>Hillbilly Elegy </em>is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.</p><b>J. D. Vance</b> is a former Marine and a graduate of Yale Law School.

Drawing on Korean legend and myth, as well as an Asian woman?s unique perspective on the United States, Lee weaves her compelling personal narrative with a collective and accessible history of modern Korea, from Japanese colonialism to war-era comfort women, from the genocide of the Korean War to the government persecution and silence of Cold War-era pogroms. The ritual of storytelling, which she shares with the women of her family, serves as a window into a five-generation family saga, and it is through storytelling that Lee comes to appreciate the sacrifices of her ancestors and her own now American place in her family and society. In To Kill A Tiger Lee provides a revelatory look at war and modernization in her native country, a story of personal growth, and a tribute to the culture that formed her.</p><p><b>Jid Lee</b> came to the United States as an inter-national student and became a citizen in 1989.

She is the author of the book <i>From the Promised Land to Home</i> and a tenured professor of English at Middle Tennessee State University.Praise for "To Kill a Tiger" <br> "Part memoir, part social history, "To Kill a Tiger" seamlessly ties together Jid Lee's moving personal narrative of girlhood in South Korea and the story of Korea's traumatic modern history of division, colonization, and war, and of South Korea's tumultuous road to democracy. Lee's accessible and engaging writing style, combined with her authoritative voice on Korean history and politics, makes "To Kill a Tiger" an invaluable resource to anyone who wants to know more about the divided Korean peninsula and the United States' role in it. It is a rare treat to read about this era of South Korean history from the perspective of a Korean woman. Through her personal experiences, Lee speaks out against the unjust treatment of women that occurs systematically both in the intimate registers of domestic life and at the level of social administration. The publication of this book is a triumph and a testament to Lee's courage." -- Grace M.

The ship, its hundreds of shipping containers, and its entire crew plummeted to the bottom of the ocean, three miles down. It was the greatest seagoing US merchant marine shipping disaster since World War II. The massive ship had a seasoned crew, state-of-the-art navigation equipment, and advance warning of the storm. It seemed incomprehensible that such a ship could sink so suddenly. How, in this day and age, could something like this happen?<br> <br>Relying on Coast Guard inquest hearings, as well as on numerous interviews, George Michelsen Foy brings us &#x201c;the most insightful exploration of this unthinkable disaster&#x201d; (<i>Outside</i>), a story that lasts only a few days, but which grows almost intolerably suspenseful as deep-rooted flaws leading to the disaster inexorably link together and worsen. We see captain, engineers, and crew fight for their lives, and hear their actual words (as recorded on the ship&#x2019;s black box) while the hurricane relentlessly tightens its noose around the ship. We watch, minute by minute, all that is happening on board&#x2014;the ship&#x2019;s mysterious tilt to one side, worried calls to the engine room, ship-to-shore reports, the courage of the men and women as they fight to survive, and the berserk ocean&#x2019;s savage consumption of the massive hull.

It is also enriched by her extraordinary photographic archive. Beautiful struts and architectural details that have long been missing from the sites where Slusser first saw them are shown once again in situ in this work, and new photographs, largely the work of Neil Greentree, reveal a wealth of previously unsuspected detail.

I'm Just Not Hitting." </p><p> I think your life depends on your attitude. How you face things says a lot about you and about how people treat you, a lot about what you can do and can't do, a lot about your happiness or unhappiness. You are what you think; maybe that's why some people need attitude adjustments. </p><p> Nobody can be all smiley all the time, but having a good, positive attitude isn't something to shrug off. It starts right when you wake up -- for me that's six o'clock -- and you can almost tell if it's going to be a good day or a miserable one by how you feel in your head. There are lots of things in life you can't control, but how you respond to those things is the one thing you <i>can</i> control. </p><p> I always believed in myself, believed in my abilities. Everybody in baseball -- everybody in life -- goes through periods where you can't seem to do anything right, where it's easy to get down on yourself or get discouraged. If I wasn't hitting, I figured that I just wasn't hitting, not that I couldn't hit. I didn't learn how to hit in a day, and I wasn't going to forget how to hit in a day, or even a week. That's how I kept myself positive, by not getting all negative. </p><p> I try to accomplish something each day. Do something good. I work out almost every morning, and that makes me feel like I started the day right. Honestly, everybody has a bad day, but usually you can think of something that you did that was OK, so the day wasn't a total loss. If I wasn't hitting, I could still help us win by how I worked with a pitcher from behind the plate. Today, if things are going wrong around the house, maybe it's a good day to work on the lawn or to paint the shutters. As long as you keep doing stuff, your luck might turn. </p><p> Being part of the Yankees for so long, I can tell you that attitudes get passed down. Our teams from the late 1940s through the early 1960s had great camaraderie and a winning attitude. Even today you don't see guys on the Yankees moping or whining or blaming other people when things go rotten. In the 2001 World Series, Derek Jeter was having it tough because his shoulder was injured pretty bad, but he never used it as a crutch, or even mentioned it, or expressed his frustration. I think he knew that worrying about it or blaming his injury would hurt his own positive attitude, and the team's. </p><p> The best way to deal with any bad situation is to believe in yourself and have confidence that things will get better. After all, if you don't believe in you, why should anyone else? Baseball is a game of confidence, and of overcoming failures and fears. That's what life's about, too. I found that out early on as a teenager, when Branch Rickey told me that I'd never be a major-league player after a tryout in my hometown of St. Louis. I was pretty disappointed, that's for sure, but I kept a positive attitude because I thought I was good enough to make it. That rejection only made me more determined, and a year later, the Yankees signed me and things worked out OK. </p><p> Two years after that, I was in a pretty tough place, in the Navy as part of a six-man crew on a LCSS (Landing Craft Support Small) for the Normandy invasion. Our job was to shoot at the German gun emplacements to protect the troops wading ashore behind us. I understood the danger, but there really wasn't time to be scared. We worked like the devil to keep the boat moving so it wouldn't be a target. We got shot at, but we were never hit. I remember saying to myself that I was only nineteen, I'm too young to die. That's how you had to think. </p><p> The saying about turning a negative into a positive...well, I think it's true. I always look on the brighter side. My family still jokes about when I drove them up to Cooperstown for the first time. I said that we were lost, but at least we were making good time. Same thing when I was managing the Mets and we were in last place: I said it ain't over till it's over, and we made it to the World Series. I guess that was my attitude and it still is. </p><p> Copyright � 2002 by LTD Enterprises</p>Adult/High School-This pleasing book is a romp through the alphabet, from "I Ain't in a Slump.

Enter <i>Talk to Me Like I'm Someone You Love</i>.<br><br> A psychotherapist with decades of experience in counseling couples, Nancy Dreyfus hit upon the revolutionary practice outlined in this book during a couples-therapy session in which a wife's unrelenting criticism of her husband was causing him to become emotionally withdrawn. In the midst of this, Dreyfus found herself scribbling on a scrap of paper, "Talk to me like I'm someone you love" and gestured to the husband that he should hold it up. He did and within seconds the familiar power differential between the two shifted, and a gentler, more genuine connection emerged. Dreyfus was startled, then intrigued, and then motivated to create a tool that could help others.<br><br> This elegantly packaged spiral-bound book features more than one hundred of Dreyfus's "flash cards for real life"-written statements that express what we wish we could communicate to the person we love, but either can't find the right words or the right tone in which to say it. The statements include:<br><br> *<b>Taking responsibility</b>: "I realize I'm overreacting. Can you give me a minute to get sane again?"<br><br> *<b>Apologizing</b>: "I know I've really hurt you.

In this book, he presents the background and philosophy of Qigong, detailing its amazing benefits for stress reduction and in the treatment of such chronic conditions as backache, hypertension, insomnia, asthma, arthritis, and headache. In clear text, and with the help of more than one hundred photographs, he provides step-by-step instructions for two types of Qigong exercises: those that improve balance, flexibility, strength, and circulation (especially good for anyone who sits all day in an office or car); and those that derive from tai chi chaun and are learned as a short "moving program" that increases internal energy (chi) and can be used to treat specific health problems. In addition, Michael Ise explains how to use special Qigong meditation exercises to relax and recharge the body's energy and to enhance its natural ability to heal itself.<br><br>Qigong, as taught by Master Tse, is easy and fun to learn and will lead to immediate and long-lasting health benefits.<br></p><p><b>Michael Tse</b>, founder of the Tse Qigong Center in London, studied Qigong in Hong Kong and China, where he was accepted as a personal student by some of the country's finest teachers. He now teaches Qigong in London, his current residence, but gives consultations and treatments worldwide.<br>In this lucid introduction to the ancient Chinese health exercise known an Qigong, Hong Kong native Tse expertly guides readers through the origins and philosophy of Qigong before offering illustrated, step-by-step instructions. After a discussion of the benefits of Qigong (stress reduction, improved posture, weight loss, etc.), the volume presents clear, sequentially arranged directions for executing the precise movements that mimic animals (e.g., a "peeping" monkey and a flying pigeon) or rely on simple balancing and other continuous actions. Tse concludes with advice on meditation and proper breathing.

Recently separated from his wife Alice, he is doing his best as a single Dad to his seven-year-old daughter Hannah. His work seems to be going better than his home life, however. His unit at the hospital has just been named number two in the country and Eric has a devoted staff of doctors and nurses who are as caring as Eric is. But when he takes on a new patient, Eric's entire world begins to crumble. Seventeen-year-old Max has a terminally ill grandmother and is having trouble handling it. That, plus his OCD and violent thoughts about a girl he likes makes Max a high risk patient. Max can't turn off the mental rituals he needs to perform every fifteen minutes that keep him calm. With the pressure mounting, Max just might reach the breaking point. When the girl is found murdered, Max is nowhere to be found. Worried about Max, Eric goes looking for him and puts himself in danger of being seen as a "person of interest" himself. Next, one of his own staff turns on him in a trumped up charge of sexual harassment. Is this chaos all random? Or is someone systematically trying to destroy Eric's life? <i>New York Times </i>best selling author Lisa Scottoline's visceral thriller, <i>Every Fifteen Minutes, </i>brings you into the grip of a true sociopath and shows you how, in the quest to survive such ruthlessness, every minute counts.</p></p><p>LISA SCOTTOLINE is a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling and Edgar Award&#x2013;winning author of many novels.

Beyond being a quantitative reflection of productivity or bargaining power, a wage is a political arena in which working people's identity, culture, and politics are negotiated and developed. In <i>Our Daily Bread</i>, Mann examines struggles over wages to reveal ways in which the wage becomes a critical component in the making of social hierarchies of race, gender, and citizenship.<br><br>Combining a fresh analysis of radical political economy with a critical assessment of the role of white men in North American labor politics, Mann addresses the issue of class politics and places the problem of "interests" squarely at the center of political economy. Rejecting the idea that interests are self-evident or unproblematic, Mann argues that workers' interests, and thus wage politics, are the product of the ongoing effort by wage workers to focus on quality in a socioeconomic system that relentlessly quantifies. Taking three wage disputes in the natural resources industry as his case studies, Mann demonstrates that wage negotiation is not simply emblematic of economic conflict over the distribution of income but also represents critical contests in the cultural politics of identity under capitalism.<br><br></p><p>"Brilliantly argued and beautifully written."-- <i>Journal of Historical Geography</i> <br>Geoff Mann is assistant professor of geography at Simon Fraser University.</p><h2>One Book Stands Alone</h2><p>&#34;ONE BOOK STANDS ALONE&#34; IDENTIFIES THE COUNTERFEIT AUTHORITIES GUILTY OF GIVING AN UNCERTAIN SOUND.

It is certain that opinion in America will not be equipped for dealing with her own problems arising out of her relations with the Spanish American states, with Japan, with the Philippines, unless it has some fair understanding of the principles with which this book deals. Its general interest even goes farther than this: no great community like that of modern America can remain indifferent to the drift of general opinion throughout the world on matters wrapped up with issues so important as those of war and peace. That the tangible commercial and business interests of America are involved in these European events is obvious from the very factors of financial and commercial interdependence which form the basis of the argument. That the interests of Americans are inextricably, if indirectly, bound up with those of Europe, has become increasingly clear as can be proved by the barest investigation of the trend of political thought in this country.</p><p></p><h2>The Art &amp; Soul of Baking</h2><p><b>2009 IACP Cookbook Awards Winner!</b><br><br><b>Nominated for a 2009 James Beard Foundation Award.</b><br><br>Sur La Table teamed with pastry chef and baking teacher Cindy Mushet to bring you the ultimate guide to baking.

But space suits hadn&#x2019;t been invented yet so they couldn&#x2019;t.</i><br> <br><i>Then one day without warning a gang of rats bowled into the town and began causing a right rumpus...</i><br> <br>So begins Russell Brand&#x2019;s wildly funny and surprisingly wise retelling of the classic tale <i>The Pied Piper of Hamelin</i>. Whether you&#x2019;re a kid or a grown-up kid, you&#x2019;ll be chuckling the whole way through this zany story that bypasses Brand&#x2019;s more adult humor for the outrageous, the madcap, and the just plain silly.<br> <br>Maybe you&#x2019;ve heard about the Pied Piper before, with his strange music and those pompous townspeople and pesky rats. Or maybe you haven&#x2019;t. But one thing is for sure: you&#x2019;ve never heard it quite like this.</p><p>Russell Brand is a comedian, actor, radio host, and bestselling author of <i>My Booky Wook</i>. He has starred in the films <i>Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Get Him to the Greek, Despicable Me, Hop, </i>and<i> Arthur</i>, and now is the host of his own acclaimed TV series on Channel 7 in the UK, <i>The Russell Brand Show</i>. He lives in London.Gr 4&#x2013;7&#x2014;In this retelling of the medieval German folktale, the hubris-filled residents of Hamelin are overrun by a polygamous, narco-egalitarian, rat collective of the worst order. Only "gammy-legged" Sam and his mother possess any measure of humility and kindness (for which they are later rewarded). As in the original, the citizens agree to pay the curious, almost otherworldly piper if he can remove the rats. When they later renege on their promise, the piper removes the children of Hamelin as well. As the musing, interrupting narrator, Brand quietly and thoughtfully delivers asides and astute observations as to the character of Hamelin's citizens, who include Fat Dave and Sexist Bob. As the piper, Brand's voice has an almost mesmerizing quality, like the legendary piper's music, lulling the listener into a contemplative state. Sadly, occasionally brilliant phrasing and subtle commentary are sandwiched between overly exuberant character voices and crass jokes. One can write a children's book with wryly amusing social commentary; one can write a children's book replete with poop and fart jokes. It is nearly impossible to balance the two. VERDICT It will be difficult for this book to find an audience outside Brand's existing fan base. Too bad. It had promise.&#x2014;Lisa Taylor, Ocean County Library, NJ</p><h2>When The Wind Blows</h2><p>Shipped from UK, please allow 10 to 21 business days for arrival. 1st Edition. 4to. 48pp. Unpaginated.

His father was a milkman; his mother a former lady&#39;s maid. Raymond&#39;s unique characterisation of Father Christmas is based on his father - &#34;Father Christmas and the milkman both have wretched jobs: working in the cold, wet and dark.&#34; His parents also influenced the character of Jim and Hilda, the victims of nuclear fall-out, in When The Wind Blows.Raymond left school aged 15 to study painting at Wimbledon School of Art. After completing a typography course at the Central School of Art, and two years of National Service, Raymond went on to the Slade School to study painting. His first work was in advertising, but before long he was winning acclaim as a children&#39;s book illustrator as well as teaching illustration at Brighton College of Art. Raymond was awarded the Kate Greenaway Medal in 1966 for his fourth picture book, The Mother Goose Treasury, and again in 1973 for Father Christmas. Published in 1978, The Snowman is perhaps Raymond&#39;s best-loved creation. He says that the book was partly inspired by its predecessor, Fungus The Bogeyman - &#34;For two years I worked on Fungus, buried amongst muck, slime and words, so... I wanted to do something which was clean, pleasant, fresh and wordless and quick.&#34;Born: Wimbledon Park, January 18th 1934*Jobs: Artist, WriterLives: SussexFirst Book for Children: The Strange House, 1961*Raymond shares his birthday with A A Milne and Arthur Ransome</p><h2>Signs from the Heart: California Chicano Murals</h2><p><p>Over the past twenty-five years, Chicano artists have made a unique contribution to public art in California, transforming thousands of walls into colorful artworks that express the dreams, achievements, aspirations, and cultural identity of the Mexican-American community. <i>Signs From the Heart</i> tells the inside story of this new and important American art form in four interpretive essays by noted Chicano scholars about its historical, artistic, and educational significance. </p></p><p>Four essays interpreting the historical, artistic, and educational significance of Chicano murals in California.Eva Sperling Cockcroft and Holly Barnet Sanchez, Editors</p><h2>The Boer War (London to Ladysmith via Pretoria Ian Hamilton&#39;s March)</h2><p>The Boer War Winston S.

Here, and in the towns beyond, the young live hard and wear the scars. Amongst them, there&#x2019;s jilted Jimmy, whose best friend Tug is the terror of the town and Jimmy&#x2019;s sole company in his search for the missing Clancy kid; Bat, a lovesick soul with a face like a bowl of mashed up spuds&#x201d; even before Nubbin Tansey&#x2019;s boot kicked it in; and Arm, a young and desperate criminal whose destiny is shaped when he and his partner, Dympna, fail to carry out a job. In each story, a local voice delineates the grittiness of post boom Irish society. These are unforgettable characters rendered through silence, humor, and violence.<br><br>Told in Barrett&#x2019;s vibrant, distinctive prose, <i>Young Skins</i> is an accomplished and irreverent debut from a singular new voice in contemporary fiction.</p><p>Colin Barrett was born in 1982 and grew up in County Mayo, Ireland.

Talk about losing your life in order to find it. Thomas Merton's first book, <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i>, describes his early doubts, his conversion to a Catholic faith of extreme certainty, and his decision to take life vows as a Trappist. Although his conversionary piety sometimes falls into sticky-sweet abstractions, Merton's autobiographical reflections are mostly wise, humble, and concrete. The best reason to read <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i>, however, may be the one Merton provided in his introduction to its Japanese translation: "I seek to speak to you, in some way, as your own self. Who can tell what this may mean? I myself do not know, but if you listen, things will be said that are perhaps not written in this book. And this will be due not to me but to the One who lives and speaks in both." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Thomas Merton (1915-1968) was born in France and came to live in the United States at the age of 24. He received several awards recognizing his contribution to religious study and contemplation, including the Pax Medal in 1963, and remained a devoted spiritualist and a tireless advocate for social justice until his death in 1968. The Sign of Jonas was originally published in 1953.</p><h2>Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists: Unleashing the Power of Financial Markets to Create Wealth and Spread Opportunity</h2><p>Capitalism&#x2019;s biggest problem is the executive in pinstripes who extols the virtues of competitive markets with every breath while attempting to extinguish them with every action.<br><br><b>Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists</b> is a groundbreaking book that will radically change our understanding of the capitalist system, particularly the role of financial markets. They are the catalyst for inspiring human ingenuity and spreading prosperity. The perception of many, especially in the wake of never-ending corporate scandals, is that financial markets are parasitic institutions that feed off the blood, sweat, and tears of the rest of us. The reality is far different.<br><br>�Vibrant financial markets threaten the sclerotic corporate establishment and increase corporate mobility and opportunity. They are the reason why entrepreneurship flourishes and companies like The Home Depot and Wal-Mart&#x2014;mere fly specks a quarter of a century ago&#x2014;have surged as they have.<br>�They mean personal freedom and economic development for more people. Throughout history, and in most of the world today, the record is one of financial oppression. Elites restrict access to capital and severely limit not only general economic development but that of individuals as well.<br>�Open borders help check the political and economic elites and preserve competitive markets. The greatest danger of the antiglobalization movement is that it will keep the rich rich and the poor poor. Globalization forces countries to do what is necessary to make their economies productive, not what is best for incumbent elites. Open borders limit the ability of domestic politics to close down competition and to retard financial and economic growth.<br>�Markets are especially susceptible in economic downturns when the establishment can exploit public anger to restrict competition and access to capital. While markets must be free to practice &#x201c;creative destruction,&#x201d; Rajan and Zingales demonstrate the political and economic importance of a sustainable distribution of wealth and a baseline safety net. Capitalism needs a heart for its own good!<br><br>There are no iron laws of economics that condemn countries like Bangladesh to perpetual poverty or the United States to perpetual prosperity. The early years of the twentieth century saw vibrant, open financial markets that were creating widespread prosperity. Then came the &#x201c;Great Reversal&#x201d; during the Great Depression. It can&#x2014;and will&#x2014;happen again, unless there is greater understanding of what markets do, who benefits, and who really wants to either limit them or shut them down.<br><br><b>Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists</b> breaks free of traditional ideological arguments of the right and left and points to a new way of understanding and spreading the extraordinary wealth-generating capabilities of capitalism.</p><p>&#x201c;Economists usually take it for granted that markets are efficient and that a free market system will therefore prevail. Rajan and Zingales do a wonderful job of arguing that free markets, particularly free financial markets, in spite of their many benefits, are under continual threat from a variety of enemies and must be constantly fought for. Although Rajan&#x2019;s and Zingales&#x2019;s reasoning is sophisticated, they write simply, lucidly, and compellingly, and their ideas will be accessible to the general reader. The book deserves a large audience, and it would not be an exaggeration to say that the capitalist system will be more secure if it gets one.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Oliver Hart, <br>Andrew E.

Those of us who live and work in the world&#x2019;s most advanced market economy tend to take them for granted, much as a fish does water. Rajan and Zingales help us look anew and see just how politically vulnerable and fragile markets are. <b>Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists</b> is at once erudite, insightful, and prescriptive, as it moves our understanding of markets far beyond the stereotypical arguments of the right and the left.&#x201d;&#x2014;Barry Nalebuff, <br>Milton Steinbach Professor, Yale School of Management, <br>Coauthor of Co-opetition and Thinking Strategically<br><br>&#x201c;<b>Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists</b> is an innovative, thought-provoking analysis of the capitalist system. Rajan and Zingales argue that financial markets are critical for spreading the opportunities generated by capitalism. In the last few decades, we have seen the beginnings of the effects of free financial markets on business practices, a revolutionary change that is benefiting all. However, there is a danger in taking these gains too much for granted. In this timely book, the authors point to how politically fragile financial markets are and offer valuable suggestions on how modern economies can build support for them. This is a must-read for every thinking manager, in fact, for anyone who worries about the future of the capitalist system.&#x201d;&#x2014;Rajat Gupta, <br>Managing Director, McKinsey &amp; CompanyRAGHURAM G.

We glimpse a picture of her essentially secular childhood, her early spiritual awareness, her innate sense of deep compassion for others, and the curiosity that drove her classic work, <i>Mysticism</i>. We see the expression of her spiritual life move from the academic tone of <i>Mysticism</i> to a deeper, warmer hue in her later writings and retreats. Possibly most eye-opening, we witness Underhill's profound spiritual struggle of 1923-24, unsuspected by her friends and family. For the many readers who have been moved by the writings of Evelyn Underhill, and for those who are merely intrigued by mysticism or captivated by a good memoir, this book presents a vivid and deeply personal rendering of a life that was, both intellectually and spiritually, radiant.</p><p>Evelyn Underhill (1875-1941) was a gifted spiritual writer, novelist and poet, who published more than thirty books including her pivotal work, Mysticism, published in 1911. Underhill became the Upton Lecturer in the Philosophy of Religion at Manchester College in 1921 and was the first woman to give a series of lectures on theology at Oxford. <p>Bernard Bangley has authored and edited numerous books, including Christian Classics in Modern English, Talks on the Song of Songs by Bernard of Clairvaux, and Rooted in Faith: Meditations from the Reformers. A retired Presbyterian minister, Rev. Bangley lives in Virginia.</p>Evelyn Underhill (1875&#x2013;1941) is perhaps best known for her 1911 classic, Mysticism, continuously in print to the present day. An English laywoman with no theological education, she wrote more than 30 spirituality books, lectured to Oxford scholars and Church of England clergy, led spiritual retreats and encouraged ecumenism decades before women began to assume religious leadership. Bangley has selected excerpts from her published writings, journals, letters and speeches to show Underhill's personal spiritual development as she moved from cool academic reflection through struggle and doubt to settled trust: "I do feel that trusting God must mean trusting Him through thick and thin." One reason for Underhill's popularity may have been her view that mysticism was for everybody, in all circumstances: "The true mystic quest may as well be fulfilled in the market as in the cloister, by Joan of Arc on the battlefield as by Simeon Stylites on his pillar." Hers was no self-absorbed, feel-good spirituality, however: "Any spiritual view which focuses attention on ourselves, and puts the human creature with its small ideas and adventures in the center foreground, is dangerous till we recognize its absurdity." Her God was transcendent: "a Reality independent of the worshipper, which is always more or less deeply colored by mystery, and which is there first." Despite its subtitle, this book is not really a memoir; Underhill wrote in the first person only in her journals and, in any case, distrusted subjective experience.

When he is not afraid to die, he is, strangely, free to live.<br><br> &#x2014;William O. Douglas, OF MEN AND MOUNTAINS<br><br> THE SCENE IS THE EARLY 1930S, THE PLACE A NOCTURNAL harbor in Hoboken, across the Hudson River from Manhattan, where a docked ship christened the Venture is ready to sail at dawn. Out of the darkness a tall, impeccably dressed man appears and asks a grizzled night watchman, &#x201c;Say, is this the moving-picture ship?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Pictures, yeah.&#x201d; The watchman nods. &#x201c;You going on this crazy voyage?&#x201d;<br><br> The destination of the Venture is cloaked in mystery as deep as the darkness shrouding the city. All that&#x2019;s known is that Carl Denham, famed and fearless filmmaker, is at the helm of his latest movie expedition and eager to set sail for a top secret production at a far-flung and undisclosed location.<br><br> &#x201c;They say he ain&#x2019;t scared of nuthin&#x2019;,&#x201d; the watchman declares. &#x201c;If he wants a picture of a lion, he goes up to him and tells him to look pleasant!&#x201d;<br><br> And that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s troubling the impeccably dressed man, theatrical agent Charles Weston, who&#x2019;s come aboard the ship to personally break some bad news to Denham: He can&#x2019;t provide a young actress for so secretive and potentially dangerous a production. True, there&#x2019;s only one Carl Denham, and whenever he embarks on a moviemaking expedition he always brings back a picture. But that&#x2019;s not the problem.<br><br> &#x201c;Everyone knows you&#x2019;re square,&#x201d; Weston tells Denham, gentleman to gentleman, &#x201c;but you have a reputation for recklessness.&#x201d;<br><br> Carl Denham, stocky, energetic, and exuding confidence, doesn&#x2019;t need to hear this. The moviegoing public, bless them, must have a pretty face&#x2014;and Denham won&#x2019;t be denied a leading lady. He&#x2019;s poised on the brink of the ultimate moviemaking expedition and dreaming dreams no picturemaker has ever dared to dream before.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going out to make the greatest picture in the world, something that nobody&#x2019;s ever seen or heard of,&#x201d; Denham exults to a skeptical Weston. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll have to think up a lot of new adjectives when I come back.&#x201d;<br><br> Thus opened King Kong, the 1933 RKO Radio Pictures production unveiled at the nadir of the Great Depression. The picture included a glimpse of the nation&#x2019;s economic troubles as Denham took a taxi into the heart of Manhattan and witnessed a line of women waiting for soup at a rescue mission. Then he encountered a young woman who was trying to steal food from a corner stand, a virginal beauty named Ann Darrow who was nearly faint from hunger.<br><br> When the bombastic showman bought a meal in a diner for Darrow and shared his dangerous dream, Denham&#x2019;s crazy, cockeyed, all-American optimism beguiled his new leading lady. And it gripped movie audiences as well. Like Ann, audiences could leave their troubles behind and vicariously join the Venture, sailing for the mystery that waited just beyond the horizon. Moviegoers, like the loyal crew, were spared details of their destination until Denham finally shared a strange tale&#x2014;of a meeting in Singapore with a Norwegian skipper who had once picked up a canoe of dying natives blown by the winds into the open ocean. The skipper had sketched a map based on the natives&#x2019; account showing an uncharted island west of Sumatra. A map of a dream that in turn became the film producer&#x2019;s quest.<br><br> The allure for Denham was the story that went with the map, the weird rumors of an ancient wall built by a forgotten civilization and the legend of Kong, the gigantic ape of Skull Island, a prehistoric isle that time had forgotten . . .<br><br> KING KONG HAD been one of the great gambles in movie history, but when it finally emerged into public view, after a long creative gestation, it was a roaring box-office success. Kong beguiled an entire generation, and its financial returns marked the turning point for an entire film industry that had recently bottomed out but was back on an economic upswing. Kong&#x2019;s triumphant creator would be crowned in glory, thus raising Merian Coldwell Cooper to the pinnacle of Hollywood power and influence.<br><br> &#x201c;Coop,&#x201d; as he was known to many, took it all in stride. In many ways he was the unlikeliest of moviemakers. Before coming to RKO in the autumn of 1931 as the trusted right-hand man for production head David O. Selznick, he had produced only three other films. What Cooper lacked in film credits, though, he made up for in creative instinct and passion.<br><br> Although studio ballyhoo for King Kong hailed Cooper as a renowned adventurer, what was left unsaid was that Carl Denham was in fact Merian Cooper. Cooper, like Denham, had himself sailed to a lost island and discovered seemingly prehistoric creatures. Cooper had witnessed the massing of tribal warriors on the windswept plains of a kingdom in Africa, had hunted man-eating tigers in the steaming jungles. The Cooper-inspired touches for Denham ranged from allusions to celebrated movie expeditions to Weston&#x2019;s declaration to Denham, &#x201c;You have a reputation for recklessness.&#x201d; Even Denham&#x2019;s pipe smoking was a noted Cooper affectation, and there was a distinct physical resemblance between Cooper and Robert Armstrong, the veteran actor who played Kong&#x2019;s intrepid filmmaker.<br><br> As with his cinematic alter ego, moviemaking became Cooper&#x2019;s passport to adventure. During the 1920s, he created moving pictures that served audiences as a window onto the world, in an era when radio was in its infancy and television and satellite communications remained in the realm of science fiction. This was a time when oceans could be crossed only by boat, and maps had vast regions stamped &#x201c;unknown.&#x201d; Those early movie expeditions, which Cooper further celebrated in books, articles, and public presentations, influenced an entire generation and forged a paradigm for adventure that still resonates into the present day.<br><br> In Cooper&#x2019;s time, one could still strike out into a wide, wild world, sometimes guided only by legends, or seduced by the mystery of unknown places whose secrets, waiting like buried treasure, fired the imagination. Yet only a hardy few had the mettle to mount such death-defying expeditions&#x2014;Cooper&#x2019;s hunger for adventure was unusual for any age. During his life he would make his home in places like New York and Los Angeles, but Cooper was always contemptuous of the conceits and conveniences of the modern world. To him &#x201c;civilization&#x201d; was a pejorative for all that was soft and weak. He sought out danger and wilderness without regard for personal safety; the rougher it was, the better he liked it. Often it took weeks of boat travel to span the oceans and days or weeks more to reach the places where the roads came to an end. From there one had to carry on by foot or camel or horse, with each step moving farther from the remotest outpost of civilization and deeper into territories often ruled by violent peoples, places governed by magic and spirit worship, where deadly diseases and wild animals regularly thinned the local population.<br><br> Merian Cooper lived for such things. He seemed to view himself as an artist, and life itself was his art, each amazing adventure woven into an unfolding tapestry of dramatic experiences. Other men, with similarly passionate ambition, might seek to forge financial empires, and, indeed, Cooper had a taste along those lines himself. But in the final analysis, he found big business boring. Adventure, manifesting in all its forms and possibilities, was his desire. Cooper would know the terror of slipping into the brush with his rifle to face a wounded and cornered wild animal; his memories would echo with the drums and war shouts of warriors and the exotic clamor of ancient rituals. Through his heart&#x2019;s desire he molded his very existence like a potter at the wheel, dreamed his great dreams of adventure and made them come true. In a way, natural-born showman that he was, his own life story was his greatest production, and he burnished his own legend to a shining luster with each dramatic exploit.<br><br> For Coop, living dangerously was particularly sweet when he could share experiences with similarly brave souls. One of his earliest adventures was a sea voyage that nearly ended in disaster as his ship ran aground on the Red Sea. Cooper later recalled that brush with death in a diary account that revealed much of what drew him to danger: &#x201c;You risk your skin, and in the moment when life balances with death, no matter how afraid you may be, you get a touch of the animal value of existence. . . . Wind and rain beat on your face as you brace yourself to swing the wheel, as a giant wave comes crashing towards your little sailing ship. Some man trusts you above all other men and you realize what friendship means.<br><br> &#x201c;These are the seconds which give the zest and fire to existence. . . . These are the moments when conscience and memory alike are drowned in the fine physical or spiritual beauty of life.&#x201d;<br><br> Cooper wrote that diary entry in April 1924, while camped in the mountains of Persia, where he had joined a tribal migration, an adventure he was sharing with two other Americans, his young friend Ernest Schoedsack and the mysterious Marguerite Harrison, an heiress and reputed professional spy who had once saved his life. He was sitting in a tent overlooking the moonlit valley where the massing clans of the nomadic Bakhtiari tribe had pitched their black tents. The grass that sustained their flocks was dying,...</p><h2>Man o&#39; War: A Legend Like Lightning</h2><p>His trainer said that managing him was like holding a tiger by the tail. His owner compared him to "chain lightning." His jockeys found their lives transformed by him, in triumphant and distressing ways. All of them became caught in a battle for honesty.<br>Born in 1917, Man o' War grew from a rebellious youngster into perhaps the greatest racehorse of all time. He set such astonishing speed records that<i> The New York Times </i>called him a "Speed Miracle." Often he won with so much energy in reserve that experts wondered how much faster he could have gone. Over the years, this and other mysteries would envelop the great Man o' War.<br>The truth remained problematic. Even as Man o' War---known as "Big Red"---came to power, attracting record crowds and rave publicity, the colorful sport of Thoroughbred racing struggled for integrity. His lone defeat, suffered a few weeks before gamblers fixed the 1919 World Series, spawned lasting rumors that he, too, had been the victim of a fix.<br>Tackling old beliefs with newly uncovered evidence,<i> Man o' War: A Legend Like Lightning </i>shows how human pressures collided with a natural phenomenon and brings new life to an American icon. The genuine courage of Man o' War, tribulations of his archrival, Sir Barton (America's first Triple Crown winner), and temptations of their Hall of Fame jockeys and trainers reveal a long-hidden tale of grace, disgrace, and elusive redemption.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>A lifelong horse enthusiast, Dorothy Ours grew up in the history-rich states of Virginia and West Virginia.

Her other fascinations include music, art, and ghost stories.Chapter One&nbsp;<br>TWO WARS BEGIN<br>&nbsp;<br>In the green hills of Kentucky, nine days after riding his first winner, an apprentice jockey named John Patrick Loftus got an offer to sell his soul. Fourteen years old, still wearing knee pants when not in jockey uniform, he entered the fifth race at Latonia on Friday, June 24, 1910, with an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other. His mount, a classy colt named Boola Boola, could win easily. But Johnny would be far richer if he made Boola Boola lose. Thursday night, during a streetcar ride, a stranger had propositioned him: two hundred dollars to pull Boola Boola, and make long shot First Peep a "sure thing."1<br>&nbsp;<br>Two hundred dollars. In 1910, that would buy ten ounces of gold or a thousand large cans of Van Camp's pork and beans. Whatever Johnny wanted, that quick money might be the highest peak he would ever reach. Many apprentice jockeys outgrew the job within months. Johnny weighed less than 100 pounds right now, but with his stocky build, he wouldn't stay light for long. Also, as long as he remained a jockey, he performed a very dangerous job. On June 8, the day after Johnny debuted at the Latonia meet, a veteran jockey named George Glasner had suffered life-threatening injuries when his horse fell during a Latonia race. When Johnny got offered two hundred dollars to pull Boola Boola, Glasner remained hospitalized and seemed unlikely to ride ever again.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now, for losing one race, Johnny Loftus could pocket a fortune that his growing body and risky job might keep him from earning honestly . . . if he was willing to betray the trainer who believed that Johnny could be a successful race rider, and the racehorse-owning senator who trusted him with Boola Boola.<br>&nbsp;<br>Riches, or respect? As Johnny reined Boola Boola onto the track, his life balanced over a tiny saddle about four inches wide. His career balanced between truth and deceit.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thunder, lightning, and drenching rain broke the oppressive heat at Latonia--known to sweating horsemen as "Death Valley"--midway through the program on that Friday afternoon. Casual fans fled. Only horsemen and devoted gamblers stayed, and a reporter noticed the diehards "wagering heavily on their choices."2 Steering Boola Boola through the monsoon, Johnny Loftus made his choice. At the finish, he held the lead by an easy length. Only one horse launched a serious rally: First Peep, gaining like mad through the homestretch, rushing up into second place.<br>&nbsp;<br>Having kept his soul, Johnny could have kept quiet. Instead, he talked about the bribe. That should have shown what an honest boy Johnny Loftus was, letting people know that they could trust him with their good horses. Their actual response must have been a shock.<br>&nbsp;<br>Latonia laughed it off. Johnny couldn't have been tempted on Thursday night, they said, because he hadn't been hired to ride Boola Boola until Friday morning. "Loftus and those responsible for bringing the matter to the attention of the [racetrack] judges are being held to ridicule," the Louisville Courier-Journal declared. ". . . The lad's misrepresentation of facts may cause him to lose his license."3 But he did not.<br>&nbsp;<br>At second glance, logic supported Johnny's story. By Thursday morning, Boola Boola's people had known that their colt would carry only 92 pounds in Friday's race. Few jockeys could ride that light. Ted Rice, the veteran who had finished fourth with Boola Boola in the Kentucky Derby, couldn't do it. Loftus was Latonia's leading lightweight. In the sharp-eyed small town of racetrack life, a generous "stranger" easily could figure the probabilities, or even pay for not-yet-public information--and, in a public place, catch up with the new young rider who didn't know all of the serious gamblers by sight.<br>&nbsp;<br>Crooked gamblers enjoyed another sweet advantage. Although newsreels flickered in every neighborhood nickelodeon, racetracks didn't film horse races. If Johnny decided to take a dive, his trip with Boola Boola--lost in mud and rain and time--couldn't be reviewed. But immediate impressions written down by professional chart makers did remain. While Boola Boola beat First Peep by one body length, a horse named Charles F. Grainger finished third, only a half length behind First Peep. "Charles F. Grainger, weakly handled, ran a good race," the Courier-Journal's result chart noted, "and might have won with a stronger ride."4 No one asked whether Grainger's rider had dealt with a streetcar stranger.<br>&nbsp;<br>Surviving the ridicule, Johnny Loftus learned a lesson. It wasn't "Don't make up stories." It was "Keep your mouth shut."<br>&nbsp;<br>He would live by that lesson nine years later, when he rode the horse named Man o' War.<br>&nbsp;<br>Latonia's leading trainer during the summer of 1910 was an almost mummy-thin thirty-four-year-old veteran of Western cattle drives, livery stables, and county fair races. His name was H. G. Bedwell. Officially, the H.G. stood for Harvey Guy. Bedwell insisted--and liked to prove--that it stood for "Hard Guy."<br>&nbsp;<br>He had grown up very poor, in the Pacific Northwest, a region where many dreams had died. Bedwell came from parents who had followed a dream, the 1849 gold rush, across the prairies into Oregon. Like most other pioneers, they discovered there was no such thing as easy money. Late in 1876, when Harvey Guy was eighteen months old, his father died and his mother found herself with four boys to raise. Gold was a long-gone fantasy. By the time more privileged children were attending eighth grade, Harvey Guy was out on the Oregon range, living as a cowboy. In remote territory, where his life literally depended on his horsemanship, Harvey Guy Bedwell became "Hard Guy."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Hard Guy" Bedwell was not sentimental about horses, but he learned how they worked. He learned from the cow ponies that carried him through four seasons outdoors, and he learned from the riding and driving horses he rented out to travelers after establishing a livery stable in Grand Junction, Colorado. He learned how to soothe sore legs and feet, and he learned to provide his horses with plenty of good grain, hay, water, and fresh air. Somewhere along the line, he also learned about racetracks and decided that Grand Junction's fair grounds needed one. Succeeding there, he stretched his tether from fair to fair, winning more than his share. But the prize money wasn't much. And so, in his thirty-fourth year on Earth, "Hard Guy" Bedwell hatched a bold plan. Thoroughbred racehorses--the world's elite running-horse breed--would become his gold rush, and they would lead him East.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bedwell surprised Eastern horsemen in 1909 with sixteen victories during fourteen days of his first New York meet. A year later, as New York racing shuddered to a stop because of antigambling laws, Hard Guy didn't wait for the death throes. He invaded Kentucky. This should have been another golden move, but instead, Bedwell ran into trouble. The racetrack officials at Latonia had made a revolutionary decree that doping horses was a punishable offense.<br>&nbsp;<br>This was a high-minded public-relations tactic for the track, but for horsemen and handicappers, it was a startling cultural change. Horsemen had experimented with speed potions for centuries, as trainers learned that many racehorses, sooner or later, needed artificial inspiration. Some horses were scared to race; others became tired or sore. Faced with endless bills to pay, horsemen developed temporary ways to distract a horse from his troubles. Heroin earned the nickname "horse" because it kicks equines into overdrive. Morphine and other opiates, which lull humans to sleep, also trigger this ancient equine flight response. In the wild, pursued by predators, a horse runs as fast as it can or dies. Given narcotics, a horse feels unnatural sleepiness creeping into its nervous system--sleepiness like the shock caused by a carnivore's fatal bite. And so the hopped horse runs without reserve. If kept in his stall, he trots in circles until the dose finally ebbs. Let loose on a racetrack, he outruns any normal inhibition.<br>&nbsp;<br>When Bedwell came to racing, everybody knew that many horses ran "hot" and "cold." For the betting public, the main problem was noticing if a cold horse going off at long odds suddenly heated up--or vice versa. A classic example happened in 1897 at Elkton, Maryland, when a poky mare named Sister Myra suddenly won by ten lengths. Owner John Ryan, who cashed a healthy bet, admitted that it was her first time on "hop." The presiding steward, Judge Bowie, gave him strict orders: From now on, every time she runs, make sure she gets the same dose.<br>&nbsp;<br>By the time Johnny Loftus got his jockey license, recipes for hop were as plentiful as recipes for corn bread and coming by ingredients wasn't hard. Caffeine could be boiled out of black coffee. Strychnine (also used by human athletes for speeding up muscle contractions) was a common rat poison. Even cocaine, heroin, and morphine were legal for anyone with a doctor's prescription to buy from a drugstore, until prohibited by the Harrison Act of 1914--and could be bribed from pharmacists long after that. But using those mixtures effectively was a fine art. Prudent trainers experimented during morning workouts, discovering the right dope and dose for each horse. Still, anything could happen at racing time.<br>&nbsp;<br>Early in the summer of 1910, as Guy Bedwell moved from New York to Kentucky, Latonia exposed dope's dangers in the worst way. During the last race on July 1, while leading the field into the homestretch, a chestnut gelding named Charley Hill abruptly fell, slamming into the inside fence on his way down. Broken beyond repair, Charley was dragged to a far edge of the course and, in the words of a local reporter, "put out of his misery by a friendly bullet, when the main crowd had left the grounds."5 A more widely heard shot followed. "It is charged that the animal had been given a stimulant," the New York Times reported, "and the [Latonia] officials were told by a veterinarian that the effects of the drug caused the horse to fall."6 All of a sudden, a dope case was national news. Within twenty-four hours, horsemen Kay Spence and J. S. Merchant were ruled off the track. Now Latonia's eyes were open wide, but some horsemen still thought they could hide in plain sight.<br>&nbsp;<br>Three days after Charley Hill died, an experienced racer named Nadzu reached Latonia's saddling paddock in a "frenzied condition."7 Drug tests for racehorses had not yet been invented, but the paddock judge, veterinarian William Keogh, believed that he could read the body language. Taking Dr. Keogh's advice, the judges scratched Nadzu and summoned the man who owned and trained him: "Hard Guy" Bedwell, the most successful trainer on the grounds.<br>&nbsp;<br>Their decision didn't take long. On July 6, Bedwell was officially ruled off the turf. Banned from racing, he couldn't even sell his horses for their $70,000 market value. Presumably tainted by dope, they were banned, too.<br>&nbsp;<br>Latonia's righteous action surprised most racetrackers. Though impressed that mighty Bedwell was suffering the same as humble Kay Spence, horsemen doubted he would be outlawed for long. With twenty-two Thoroughbreds in his string and a high percentage of in-the-money finishes, Bedwell's presence meant a quality racing product. Didn't the game need him? Spence, meanwhile, took no comfort in the impartial punishment. "I was doing my best to win and I can see no crime in that," he told the Louisville Courier-Journal, "and with my horse dead and then be handed a package like was given me, I think is pretty hard."8<br>&nbsp;<br>Ten days later, the Kentucky Racing Commission reinstated Kay Spence, who benefited from a procedural lapse: "the failure of Dr. Keogh . . . to examine the horse [Charley Hill] for evidence of doping either before or after his death."9 Bedwell, however, couldn't overcome the raw truth that Nadzu had been hopped. He claimed that one of his grooms had taken a gambler's bribe to dose Nadzu with cocaine, and he presented telegrams of support from several of racing's most prestigious men, including Jockey Club chairman August Belmont, Jr. The commission was unmoved. For several months, they firmly backed Dr. Keogh's testimony. But Dr. Keogh died that autumn. Bedwell kept agitating. Early in 1911, he regained his license and promptly became the nation's leading trainer by number of wins.<br>&nbsp;<br>There was more to his success than dope. Any fool could get his hands on that. Veterinarian Frank M. Keller would recall, "The best trainer I've ever seen with bad-legged horses was H. Guy Bedwell."10 Those bad-legged runners owed some of Bedwell's magic to clever blacksmithing and pharmacy, and even more to the galaxy of limitations he had managed with the cow ponies, livery stable nags, and county fair racers. They also benefited from the skilled help Bedwell chose to employ.<br>&nbsp;<br>Early in 1912, with Kentucky racing closed for the winter, Bedwell migrated to a Charleston, South Carolina, track so new that its dirt was still settling. From prominent trainer Rome Respess, he borrowed Kentucky's most promising young jockey: sixteen-year-old Johnny Loftus.<br>&nbsp;<br>For Johnny, this assignment couldn't have been easy. A fierce perfectionist, Bedwell liked to keep his employees living in fear. But for a few weeks at Palmetto Park, he and Loftus exploited each other's abilities to an improbable degree. Eleven days into the meet, Bedwell had won every stakes race offered. A month into the meet, the Louisville Courier-Journal proudly noted that, "Loftus stands head and shoulders above all the other jockeys . . ."11 Bedwell was giving him sharp horses, and Loftus was making the most of them.<br>&nbsp;<br>After Johnny's contract obligations pulled them apart, respect for each other's skill remained. Reunited seven years later, they would develop a champion colt who would rival Man o' War.<br>&nbsp;<br>First, however, August Belmont had to prepare the way.<br>&nbsp;<br>Man o' War's life, and Thoroughbred racing's survival in the eastern United States, depended on a short and suave Manhattan-based financier named August Belmont, Jr.12 He presided over a select society called The Jockey Club.<br>&nbsp;<br>Despite his jockeylike height and his skill as a polo player, Belmont never had been a professional race rider. Despite its name, The Jockey Club of New York was never open to professional jockeys. Only socially prominent racehorse owners were invited to join. They didn't make their living on the back of a galloping horse, but they did make racing's rules. Formed in 1894 to fight corruption, The Jockey Club vowed to make certain that each horse entered in every race was the same runner actually brought to the starting post, and to investigate whenever a horse performed much better or much worse than its known ability.

After fierce struggles, three women&#x2014;Diane Sawyer, Katie Couric, and Christiane Amanpour&#x2014;broke into the newsroom&#x2019;s once impenetrable &#x201c;boys&#x2019; club.&#x201d; These women were not simply pathbreakers, but wildly gifted journalists whose unique talents enabled them to climb to the top of the corporate ladder and transform the way Americans received their news.<br><br>Drawing on exclusive interviews with their colleagues and intimates from childhood on, <i>The News Sorority</i> crafts a lively and exhilarating narrative that reveals the hard struggles and inner strengths that shaped these women and powered their success. Life outside the newsroom&#x2014;love, loss, child rearing&#x2014;would mark them all, complicating their lives even as it deepened their convictions and instincts. Life <i>inside</i> the newsroom would include many nervy decisions and back room power plays previously uncaptured in any media account. Taken together, Sawyer&#x2019;s, Couric&#x2019;s, and Amanpour&#x2019;s lives as women are here revealed not as impediments but as keys to their success.<br><br>Raised in Louisville, Kentucky, Diane Sawyer was a young woman steering her own unique political course in a time of societal upheaval. Her fierce intellect, almost insuperable work ethic, and sophisticated emotional intelligence would catapult Sawyer from being the first female on-air correspondent for <i>60 Minutes</i>, to presenting anchoring the network flagship <i>ABC World News</i>. From her first breaks as a reporter all the way through her departure in 2014, Sawyer&#x2019;s charisma and drive would carry her through countless personal and professional changes.<br><br>Katie Couric, always conveniently underestimated because of her &#x201c;girl-next-door&#x201d; demeanor, brazened her way through a succession of regional TV news jobs until she finally hit it big. In 1991, Couric became the cohost of <i>Today</i>, where, over the next fifteen years, she transformed the &#x201c;female&#x201d; slot from secondary to preeminent while shouldering devastating personal loss. Couric&#x2019;s greatest triumph&#x2014;and most bedeviling challenge&#x2014;was at <i>CBS Evening News</i>, as the first woman to solo-anchor a nighttime network news program. Her contradictions&#x2014;seriously feminist while proudly sorority-girlish&#x2014;made her beyond easy typecasting, and as original as she is relatable.<br><br>A glamorous, unorthodox cosmopolite&#x2014;raised in pre-revolution Iran amid royalty and educated in England&#x2014;Christiane Amanpour would never have been picked out of a lineup as a future war reporter, until her character flourished on catastrophic soil: her family&#x2019;s exile during the Iranian Revolution. Once she knew her calling, Amanpour shrewdly made a virtue of her outsider status, joining the fledgling CNN on the bottom rung and then becoming its &#x201c;face,&#x201d; catalyzing its rise to global prominence. Amanpour&#x2019;s fearlessness in war zones would make her the world&#x2019;s witness to some of its most acute crises and television&#x2019;s chief advocate for international justice.<br><br>Revealing the tremendous combination of ambition, empathy, and skill that empowered Sawyer, Couric, and Amanpour to reach stardom, <i>The News Sorority</i> is a detailed story of three very particular lives and a testament to the extraordinary character of women everywhere.<br><br><b>New York Daily News</b><br>&#x201c;This immensely readable book made headlines before publication for its irresistible gossip.

Pushing Past Grief: Diane, 1969<br>Twenty-three-year-old Diane Sawyer (she used her real first name, Lila, ironically, only in affectionate letters) was working as the first ever full-time female news reporter in her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky&#x2014; on WLKY, Channel 32&#x2014;in mid-September 1969. She had been on the job for two years, and she&#x2014;a Wellesley graduate and former beauty queen&#x2014; was itching to leave for a bigger opportunity, in the nation&#x2019;s capital. Still, Diane&#x2019;s years at WLKY had not been uneventful.</p><p>Louisville in the late 1960s had a roiling temper. Some of its residents were hell-bent on overturning the recent federally mandated civil rights advances. When black demonstrators peacefully marched through the streets to protest the stubbornly still segregated neighborhoods, angry whites rushed them, bearing swastikas, hurling bottles. On top of that, the country had just passed through a nightmare of a year, and Diane Sawyer of WLKY had reported on all of it.</p><p>Diane and her colleague Bob Winlock&#x2014;who rejected being &#x201c;the black reporter&#x201d; as much as she disliked being &#x201c;the female reporter&#x201d;&#x2014;witnessed painful backlash against advances they had both been a part of. Diane was kept off the riot-scene beat by her gallant bosses&#x2014;at least one frontline reporter had gotten beaten&#x2014;but the city&#x2019;s racial anguish was on clear display everywhere, including during the emotionally fraught press conferences she covered for the station.</p><p>Violence became commonplace. Early in her tenure at WLKY, Martin Luther King Jr. had been spat upon by a little white girl who couldn&#x2019;t have been more than seven. During another visit, the civil rights leader&#x2019;s skull had barely evaded a rock hurled through his car window (he later held the rock high and pronounced it a &#x201c;foundation&#x201d; of his struggle there). Then, of course, came Dr. King&#x2019;s murder&#x2014;close by, in Memphis&#x2014;and that of Bobby Kennedy, in Los Angeles, during that surreally violent patch of spring to summer 1968. &#x201c;Diane was disconsolate&#x201d; at both assassinations, the station&#x2019;s general manager, Ed Shadburne, says. Still, she dutifully went out to get person-on-the-street responses. That was being a reporter: Tuck in the pain and do your job. You were a witness.</p><p>But that was the ironic thing. Diane had already been a witness&#x2014; indeed, a participant&#x2014;in some amazing ground-level integration gains almost a full decade earlier. Her junior high and high school, Seneca, had integrated startlingly early, in 1957, well before the city&#x2019;s neighborhoods, restaurants, restrooms, and theaters had stopped barring blacks or roping them off in dingy &#x201c;Coloreds&#x201d; quarters. By a fluke of the school&#x2019;s newness and geography, the 1957&#x2013;1963 Seneca kids (&#x201c;a third white, a third Jewish, a third black,&#x201d; the alums today like to proudly exaggerate) and their teachers were on their own, improvising a racial amity.</p><p>In 1958, when Diane was in the eighth grade (four years before James Meredith&#x2019;s federally assisted singular integration of the University of Mississippi), white boys in ducktails and low-slung jeans had written GO HOME, NIGGER! on the walls when the first black students bravely but nervously entered, and some of the kids were beaten. But by the time her class reached eleventh grade, in 1961, the students were protesting restaurant segregation together. When the boys&#x2019; basketball team traveled to racist Kentucky towns for away games, the white players refused to go into the coffee shops that didn&#x2019;t allow their black teammates; they all ate in their bus. Now, in 1969, the still resonating killings of Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy seemed like a Molotov cocktail hurled against those fragile, cherished Seneca High advances.</p><p><br><b>. . .</b></p><p><br>Diane&#x2019;s family was her stable haven during a period of violence, regression, and sadness. Even as a working reporter four months shy of twenty-four, she was still living at home with her parents.</p><p>The elder Sawyers had come to their security and respectability the hard way. Erbon Powers Sawyer and Jean Dunagan Sawyer had grown up during the Depression in dire poverty in the Appalachian Mountains of Kentucky, just north of the Tennessee border. Diane&#x2019;s father was one of nine siblings. Diane&#x2019;s mother, whose parents had the folksy names of Foxie and Norma Belle, was one of four daughters. The Dunagan children teetered on the brink of starvation. &#x201c;There were sometimes only pennies and a few potatoes in winter&#x2014;there were bruises, real bruises in that life&#x201d; of theirs, Diane has said. Erbon and Jean had limited themselves to two children. Diane&#x2019;s two-year-older sister, Linda, was the vivacious, prettier girl; Diane was the adoring little sister&#x2014;circumspect, awkwardly tall, her poor eyesight requiring thick glasses.</p><p>The Sawyer family was comfortable but not seriously prosperous. The bar was very high in Louisville, a city of century-old debutante balls and Kentucky Derby Winners&#x2019; Circle families of six generations of gentry who patronized the exclusive fox-hunting clubs in Lexington. Diane&#x2019;s father had made it up from a tiny junior college all the way through law school, and by 1969 he had long been the Jefferson County judge&#x2014;Judge &#x201c;Tom&#x201d; Sawyer his jaunty sobriquet. Jean Sawyer&#x2014;&#x201c;Mrs. Sawyer&#x201d; to decades of students&#x2014;officiated at the blackboard at Hite Elementary. She was known as the best third-grade teacher in the city.</p><p>The Sawyer family was deeply Methodist. Diane had attended Methodist Youth Association camp, and, as busy as she now was as a reporter, she still made it to practice two evenings a week to blend her gifted soprano, on classic hymns, with a m�lange of other voices in the St. David&#x2019;s Church&#x2013;based choir called the Motet Singers. When Diane was growing up, the Sawyers had hosted home Bible meetings on Sunday and sometimes Wednesday nights at their home, while their family church, St. Mark&#x2019;s, was under construction. &#x201c;Purpose&#x201d; was a word heard in many sermons. The ideal&#x2014;to live a life &#x201c;of purpose&#x201d;&#x2014;was also fortified by Judge Sawyer.</p><p>&#x201c;Diane&#x2019;s father was the one who really put the idea of &#x2018;purpose&#x2019; in her life; he was her moral compass,&#x201d; says her close friend ABC producer Mark Robertson, on the basis of what she has told him. &#x201c;She always says, &#x2018;Those are real lives at stake!&#x2019;&#x201d; of her responsibility to the people whose stories she is telling on television. &#x201c;That came from her father.&#x201d;</p><p>Judge Sawyer was a serious man&#x2014;a thoughtful intellectual. Diane&#x2019;s love of D. H. Lawrence and e. e. cummings seems to have derived from his respect for literature. Diane was very close to him, a closeness amplified by the serendipitous fact that she was the spitting image of his sister Lila, after whom she&#x2019;d been named. She&#x2019;d even tried law school for one semester, mainly, friends say, because law was what he did.</p><p>Judge Sawyer was paternal in an old-fashioned way. Just after Diane had been hired at WLKY, he had pointedly dropped in one day, unannounced, on the station&#x2019;s general manager to make good and sure that this man who&#x2019;d hired his daughter did not have any designs on her. He was a fierce Republican&#x2014;Diane&#x2019;s eventual, abiding loyalty to Richard Nixon, incomprehensible to so many, owes much to his strong party affiliation. Yet the judge was not stern; he had a palpable sense of compassion. The judge&#x2019;s &#x201c;love for his family, intellectual curiosity, and evenhandedness were as perfect as a person&#x2019;s could be,&#x201d; says Diane&#x2019;s high school English teacher and confidante, Alice Chumbley Lora. Finally, Judge Sawyer had given Diane the yardstick by which she chose her profession. &#x201c;Answer three questions,&#x201d; he said one day. &#x201c;One: What are you passionate about? Two: What can you have adventure doing? Three: What can you do to make a difference?&#x201d; Four decades later she would recount those unforgettably impactful words to a young ABC News female prot�g�e.</p><p>Diane&#x2019;s mother was perhaps an even greater influence. Jean Sawyer was not an intellectual (&#x201c;I never saw Mrs. Sawyer reading a book,&#x201d; one friend says), but she was a seizer of life, an ambitious perfectionist&#x2014;and Diane was awed by this. &#x201c;Growing up, I didn&#x2019;t have distant idols, I had proximate ones,&#x201d; Diane once made clear.</p><p>Jean Sawyer had a tremendous hold on her daughters. &#x201c;Diane&#x2019;s mother was a very, very aggressive woman. She was a force of nature,&#x201d; says Greg Haynes, a Louisville friend whom Diane dated in college. &#x201c;She pushed her daughters into all these beauty contests.&#x201d; And lessons: Diane took piano, ballet, tap, voice, classical guitar, and fencing, sacrificing her social life for the palette of activities her mother lined up. &#x201c;Mrs. Sawyer was a 1950s version of the Tiger Mom,&#x201d; says one who knew the family: pushing her daughters, using criticism to make sure they did their best. Every opportunity Jean Sawyer hadn&#x2019;t had, she made sure her daughters did have. &#x201c;Mrs. Sawyer was very ambitious for her daughters,&#x201d; Haynes says. &#x201c;She was extremely devoted to their achievement.&#x201d; Sometimes it seemed that was all she cared about. It was as if so much insecurity had suffused Jean&#x2019;s and Erbon&#x2019;s youths, the opposite would now be fiercely willed. A pristine security, unmarred by lack of opportunity&#x2014;and certainly unmarred by tragedy&#x2014;would be obtained for the Sawyer girls, come hell or high water.</p><p>And then, on September 23, 1969, that plan&#x2014;that dream&#x2014;fell apart in an instant.</p><p>Diane&#x2019;s father had risen early that morning and gotten into his car to drive to work. The route was familiar enough to be rote; he had driven it innumerable times. Somehow, this morning, something went very wrong very fast. Minutes from his home, while ascending an overpass above the interstate highway, his car suddenly veered and shot off the unshielded bridge abutment, over the overpass. Did the judge fall asleep at the wheel? Did a tire blow out? Whatever the cause, rumors would circulate, all unconfirmed, that the fatal plunge was a suicide.</p><p>Louisville in 1969 was a small town when tragedies happened, so it was not surprising that the first newsperson who heard of the accident happened to be a member of Diane&#x2019;s Motet Singers: Bob McDonald, a reporter at radio station WKLO. He was announcing the morning news when the bulletin came in that the judge&#x2019;s car had plummeted and he&#x2019;d been taken to General Hospital, where Diane and Jean were now rushing. Judge Sawyer&#x2019;s death was announced on WKLO; then Jim Smith, Diane&#x2019;s WLKY assignment editor, assumed the grim task of filming the removal of his junior colleague&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s destroyed vehicle for airing on the very newscast, that evening, to which Diane normally would have contributed.</p><p>WLKY&#x2019;s news director, Ken Rowland, rushed to the Sawyer house to pay a condolence call. The women were &#x201c;in shock more than anything,&#x201d; he recalls, like &#x201c;any other family who&#x2019;s just lost someone in a tragic accident that there&#x2019;s no real explanation for.&#x201d; Diane&#x2019;s friend Greg Haynes hurried to the funeral home. &#x201c;Diane was very distraught,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;She was devastated.&#x201d;</p><p>At Judge Sawyer&#x2019;s funeral service the Motet Singers performed one of his favorite songs, &#x201c;The Battle Hymn of the Republic.&#x201d; The judge had been a navy officer in World War II and he was a border-Southern post-war Republican&#x2014;which meant: anti-Dixiecrat. He&#x2019;d stood up for some ideals that were regionally unpopular. Choir member Celia McDonald re- members, &#x201c;The family&#x201d;&#x2014;Jean, Linda, Diane&#x2014;&#x201c;was just crushed&#x201d; as they sat in their pews through the service.</p><p>For Jean Sawyer and her daughters, this grievous loss was also perhaps a grim reminder: For all the effort taken in thwarting them, storms of awful luck, like Depression winter winds, could still destructively whoosh out of nowhere in a heartbeat. Diane&#x2019;s good friend ABC executive Phyllis McGrady views this moment as a turning point: &#x201c;They lost their husband and father, these three real Southern women: charming, delightful, perfect manners yet unbelievably determined.&#x201d; From this point on, Jean taught her daughters &#x201c;they didn&#x2019;t have to find a man to lead them through this world,&#x201d; Mark Robertson says Diane told him. This was not your typical midcentury Southern mother-to-daughter lesson&#x2014;proper young women in the region at the time were supposed to marry upon graduation from college&#x2014;and it was one that Diane took to heart, with good result. She would become enormously successful as a single woman and would not marry until she was forty-two. In the wake of her father&#x2019;s death, Diane&#x2019;s determination leapt into overdrive. She surprised everyone by returning to the WLKY newsroom sooner than expected. Jim Smith recalls, &#x201c;She was not out that long. She was determined to go on and do her job and we respected her for that.&#x201d; Work emerged as an ennobling, distracting, consoling&#x2014;and healing&#x2014;device.</p><p>Dogged dedication would become Diane&#x2019;s defining characteristic, at once a key to her remarkable success and a challenge for her colleagues. Even now, long past the years of earning her due, Diane barely sleeps, is known to e-mail staffers in the middle of the night, and works (says a male producer whom she fired) &#x201c;harder than ten people.&#x201d; That dedication would guide her journey&#x2014;and an eventful journey, artfully navigated, it would be.</p><p>When this high-achieving Louisville girl had gone on to Wellesley College, she&#x2019;d encountered Northeastern elitism (a little discomfiting at first) but had absorbed its useful value system, and had won distinction as a singing star. Then she utilized her instinctive ownership of the brand-new ideas about women and ambition during her two years at WLKY. Next&#x2014;after her father&#x2019;s death&#x2014;she would blend personal independence with a political conservatism unshared by most of the emerging journalists of her generation, and she would work loyally, for eight years, for the most disgraced president in recent history. In that crucible&#x2014;playing defense against an aggressive and triumphant press corps&#x2014;she would sharpen her intellectual fighting skills. After that, she would meld her daunting work ethic with a deft humility in the service of proving herself to highly skeptical colleagues at her first major national news job. From then on she would soar, becoming, over the decades, a star in every TV news format, minting a compelling persona that was at once glamorous and serious&#x2014;and winding up in the pinnacle position as a 6:30 anchor.</p><p>Throughout, she has been impelled by that Methodist-sermon word&#x2014; her father&#x2019;s word, purpose. It&#x2019;s a simple word, employed by a complex woman. Nicknamed the Golden Sphinx, Diane incites awe for being an unsurpassable player of the chess game of career machinations. But while her seductive charm and elegant indirectness are legendary, so is her generosity. Not everyone who has worked with Diane trusts her, though nearly all of them respect her.</p><p>She witnessed fickle loss in her family and fickle cruelty in her community: mysteries that make a person seek answers to troubling questions. She was &#x201c;never not sophisticated,&#x201d; even as a poodle-skirt-wearing small-city girl, says her hometown friend Greg Haynes, and she married one of America&#x2019;s most sophisticated men. Her curiosity, both about the painful mesh of agency and fate and about the world&#x2019;s wide swath of arts...</p></p><h2>Love Hina, Vol. 5</h2><p>Follows the romantic adventures of Keitaro Urashima after his plans for the future are derailed when he fails to pass the Tokyo University entrance exam and he becomes the reluctant landlord of the all-girl Hinata House.</p><p></p><h2>Streets of Gold: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>A Polish girl comes to America at the turn of the century in this fast-paced historical novel about the immigrant experience.</strong></p> It's 1901.

Today, peoples such as the Blackfoot and Sioux still live in groups bound by language and shared rituals. From about 1800, one of the most important units beyond the extended family was the &#39;warrior society&#39; - a social, political and ritual group that engaged in warfare and organised ceremonial life. The societies played a prominent role in battles, offering members the opportunity to gain honours through individual acts of bravery such stealing horses, capturing women, and taking scalps during war raids. These societies, however, have a rich ritual life that was marked by a strong sense of spirituality. In their ceremonies society members made use of objects such as pipes, rattles, and headdresses, as these were significant to their shared ideas of ritual and honour. Through a selection of unique objects from the British Museum&#39;s collection, this beautifully illustrated little book explores the world of the warriors of the North American Plains. Here are exceptional examples of feather headdresses, shields, moccasins, painted hides, scalps, pipes, tomahawks, and traditional and contemporary costumes. Many of these items may seem initially familiar from popular culture, but their deeper ritual significance is revealed by the author. A perennially popular subject, this book will appeal to young and old alike.</p><p>Max Carocci has been conducting research on Plains Indians since 1989. He curated the 2010 British Museum exhibition &#39;Warriors of the Plains: 200 Years of Native North American Honour and Ritual&#39;, on which this book is based. The exhibition is now touring to UK venues.</p><h2>The Wasps, The Poet and the Women &amp; The Frogs (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Aristophanes; tr. by David Barrett, Wasps, The; the Poet and the Women; the Frogs</p><p><b>Aristophanes</b> was born, probably in Athens, c. 449 BC and died between 386 and 380 BC. Little is known about his life, but there is a portrait of him in Plato's <b>Symposium</b>. He was twice threatened with prosecution in the 420s for his outspoken attacks on the prominent politician Cleon, but in 405 he was publicly honored and crowned for promoting Athenian civic unity in <b>The Frogs</b>. Aristophanes had his first comedy produced when he was about twenty-one, and wrote forty plays in all. The eleven surviving plays of Aristophanes are published in the Penguin Classics series as <b>The Birds and Other Plays</b>, <b>Lysistrata and Other Plays</b>, and <b>The Wasps/The Poet and the Women/The Frogs</b>.</p><h2>Queen of the Conqueror: The Life of Matilda, Wife of William I</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER<br></b><br>Around the year 1049, William, Duke of Normandy and future conqueror of England, raced to the palace of Baldwin V, Count of Flanders. The count&#x2019;s eldest daughter, Matilda, had refused William&#x2019;s offer of marriage and publicly denounced him as a bastard. Encountering the young woman, William furiously dragged her to the ground by her hair and beat her mercilessly. Matilda&#x2019;s outraged father immediately took up arms on his daughter&#x2019;s behalf. But just a few days later, Baldwin was aghast when Matilda, still recovering from the assault, announced that she would marry none but William, since &#x201c;he must be a man of great courage and high daring&#x201d; to have ventured to &#x201c;come and beat me in my own father&#x2019;s palace.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Thus began the tempestuous marriage of Matilda of Flanders and William the Conqueror. While William&#x2019;s exploits and triumphs have been widely chronicled, his consort remains largely overlooked. Now, in her groundbreaking <i>Queen of the Conqueror,</i> acclaimed author and historian Tracy Borman weaves together a comprehensive and illuminating tapestry of this noble woman who stood only four-foot-two and whose role as the first crowned Queen of England had a large and lasting influence on the English monarchy.<br> &nbsp;<br> From a wealth of historical artifacts and documents, Matilda emerges as passionate, steadfast, and wise, yet also utterly ruthless and tenacious in pursuit of her goals, and the only person capable of taming her formidable husband&#x2014;who, unprecedented for the period, remained staunchly faithful to her. This mother of nine, including four sons who went on to inherit William&#x2019;s French and English dominions, confounded the traditional views of women in medieval society by seizing the reins of power whenever she had the chance, directing her husband&#x2019;s policy, and at times flagrantly disobeying his orders.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tracy Borman lays out Matilda&#x2019;s remarkable story against one of the most fascinating and transformative periods in European history. Stirring, richly detailed, and wholly involving, <i>Queen of the Conqueror </i>reveals not just an extraordinary figure but an iconic woman who shaped generations, and an era that cast the essential framework for the world we know today.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Queen of the Conqueror</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;[Tracy Borman] brings to life Queen Matilda&#x2019;s enormous accomplishments in consolidating early Norman rule.

Even the date of her birth cannot be deduced with any certainty fromthe surviving sources. At the earliest, it would have been toward the end ofthe year 1031. Her parents were the future Count Baldwin V of Flanders andAdela, daughter of Robert II "the Pious," King of France, by histhird wife, Constance of Arles. Their marriage took place in 1028. The Normanchronicler William of Jumi�ges, who was a direct contemporary of Matilda,claims that it was not consummated until 1031, and that the long period ofwaiting was one of the factors that incited Baldwin to rebel against his fatherthat year. In fact, young Baldwin had already rebelled soon after the wedding;it seemed that an alliance with French royal blood had given him an inflatedsense of his own importance, and he therefore contested his father's positionas count. The two men came to terms in 1030 and a truce was concluded wherebythey agreed to rule jointly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the rumor of its delayed consummation, Baldwinand Adela's marriage was said to have been blessed with "a numerousprogeny of gifted sons and daughters." However, the only children we canbe certain of are Matilda and her two brothers, Baldwin and Robert, and it isnot clear in what order they were born. Matilda is often referred to last inthe lists provided by contemporary chroniclers, but this does not necessarilymean that she was the youngest child: daughters were seen as being of secondaryimportance to sons and were often left out of accounts altogether.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If Matilda's age was uncertain, her pedigree was not. Oneof the most prominent chroniclers of the age introduces her to his readers as"the highly born Matilda." This was no mere flattery. Born into theruling family of one of the most important principalities in Europe, she couldtrace her descent from impressive stock. The Flemish counts had the mostdistinguished lineage of any nonroyal house in Europe. Her father's maleforebears had been counts of Flanders since the ninth century and weredescended from the great Charlemagne, founding father of the French and Germanempires. Count Baldwin II had married the daughter of King Alfred the Great-analliance with Saxon blood that would prove useful to Matilda. Moreover, as thegranddaughter of a French king, she retained strong royal connections. OnRobert II's death in 1031, her maternal uncle, Henry, had become king ofFrance, and another uncle, Robert, had inherited the dukedom of Burgundy the followingyear, and so through her mother's side of the family, Matilda was related tomost of the great nobility of France.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her parents chose a name to emphasize this impressivepedigree. "Matilda" was a highly unusual moniker in Flanders andFrance at the time of her birth. It came from the old Teutonic"Machtild" and was firmly rooted in Baldwin's German ancestry. Withher illustrious lineage, Matilda was a great prize in the internationalmarriage market-even more so given the immense strategic importance of theprincipality in which she was born. Flanders was situated in the heart ofwestern Europe, embracing parts of modern-day Belgium, northern France, and theNetherlands. Its name derived from the area around Bruges known as the PagusFlandrensis. It had been dominated by Germanic tribes for several hundred yearsbefore becoming part of an empire established by Charlemagne in the ninthcentury. The first known count, Baldwin I, ensured his family's fortune in late861 by eloping with Judith, the eldest child of the Carolingian emperor Charlesthe Bald. His lands were at that time limited to the prosperous town of Ghentin eastern Flanders, but when he finally married Judith in 863, he was grantedthe Pagus Flandrensis. The marriage greatly enhanced the prestige of the countyby uniting it with both the French and English royal families.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Under Baldwin I's leadership and that of his son, BaldwinII, Flanders was made secure against the incursions of the Vikings, who hadplagued the province for many years. The latter added other territories to thecounty so that it comprised a sprawling area of land bordering parts ofNormandy, northern France, and the Germanic empire. Baldwin II's marriage toAelfthryth, the daughter of King Alfred the Great, also strengthened ties withEngland. In the early part of the tenth century, their grandson, Baldwin III,laid the basis for the future industrial and commercial greatness of the regionby establishing the wool and silk industries at Ghent and instituting annual fairsat Bruges and other towns. Prior to this, their son, Arnulf I, who succeeded ascount in 918, had embarked upon an ambitious campaign to extend the Flemishterritory southward. His attempt to take the strategically important town ofMontreuil-sur-Mer led to conflict with William Longsword of Normandy. Therefollowed a prolonged period of hostilities as each tried to gain the upperhand, which culminated with William's murder by Arnulf's men in 942. Thisrivalry between Flanders and Normandy continued to dominate Flemish foreignpolicy until the middle of the eleventh century, when Matilda's marriagebrought it to an end.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although it was later to become a thriving center ofcommerce and culture, in the early eleventh century Flanders was a primitiveplace. The landscape to the west was dominated by swamps and was barelyhabitable. The east, which was densely wooded, was comparatively more civilizedand had a higher number of inhabitants. But in contrast to neighboringNormandy, there were no bustling urban centers, and the towns that did existwere small, with rudimentary buildings. Language also presented a problem.There was no uniformity, with some areas speaking a Germanic dialect and othersFrench. It was only gradually that Flemish was adopted as the nationallanguage. It seems the populace, too, retained a certain primitivism. In 900,for example, Archbishop Fulk of Rheims scorned the inhabitants as being"of barbarous...savagery and language." Indeed, the Flemish soonbecame the butt of jokes among the more civilized nations, such as England andFrance, where they were derided for their crudity and backwardness. Theirreputation had improved little by the late twelfth century, when Richard ofDevizes advised a young man who was due to travel to England that he shouldexpect nothing but ignorance and boorishness from Cornishmen, "as we inFrance consider our Flemings."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Flanders was also a notoriously lawless area, whereviolence and uprisings were commonplace. "Daily homicides and spilling ofhuman blood had troubled the peace and quiet of the entire area," claimedthe twelfth-century Life of St. Arnulf. "Thus a great number of nobles,through the force of their prayers, convinced the bishop of the lord to visitthe places where this atrocious cruelty especially raged and to instruct thedocile and bloody spirit of the Flemings in the interest of peace andconcord."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, under the stewardship of Count Baldwin IV(988-1035), Flanders began to show signs of improvement. Its salvation wastrade. The textile industry became particularly successful, thanks to importsof wool from England and Spain. Matilda's father, Baldwin V, commissioned thebuilding of new roads and canals to stimulate the growth of trade both withinand outside Flanders. Before long, he had amassed more wealth than any of hispredecessors. This dramatically improved standards of living among hissubjects, particularly within the major urban centers. Handsome stone housesreplaced the ramshackle wooden dwellings of former days, and the citizens alsobenefited from the dazzling array of exotic goods that arrived into theprincipality from far-flung corners of the globe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By the time of Baldwin V's reign, then, Flanders wasenjoying increasing wealth. Given the new count's overweening pride andambition, it is likely that he would have built magnificent residences for hisfamily. There are very few contemporary descriptions of the buildings andpalaces that Matilda would have known, but a detailed account by thetwelfth-century chronicler Lambert of Ardres of the castle there gives a senseof a typical stately residence of the principality. The castle was built ofwood and stood atop a large mound, towering over the rest of the town. Itsrooms were structured according to a strict hierarchy:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first storey was on the surface of the ground, wherewere cellars and granaries, and great boxes, tuns, casks, and other domesticutensils. In the storey above were the dwelling and common living-rooms of theresidents, in which were the larders, the rooms of the bakers and butlers, andthe great chamber in which the lord and his wife slept. Adjoining this was aprivate room, the dormitory of the waiting maids and children. In the innerpart of the great chamber was a certain private room, where at early dawn or inthe evening or during sickness or at time of blood-letting, or for warming themaids and weaned children, they used to have a fire...In the upper storey ofthe house were garret rooms, in which on the one side the sons (when they wishedit), on the other side the daughters (because they were obliged), 5 of the lordof the house used to sleep. In this storey also the watchmen and servantsappointed to keep the house took their sleep at some time or other. High up onthe east side of the house, in a convenient place, was the chapel, which wasmade like unto the tabernacle of Solomon in its ceiling and painting. Therewere stairs and passages from storey to storey, from the house into thekitchen, from room to room, and again from the house into the loggia, wherethey used to sit in conversation for recreation, and again from the loggia intothe oratory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This castle belonged to the lord of Ardres, so it islikely that, as the daughter of the count of Flanders, Matilda would have knowneven greater luxury.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As well as encouraging the commercial development of hisprincipality, Matilda's father also capitalized upon Flanders's immensestrategic importance. Its situation enabled the counts to hold the balance ofpower between the kings of France to the south, the dukes of Normandy to thewest, and the German rulers to the east. This made Flanders a power to bereckoned with in medieval Europe. Baldwin V made the most of this advantage bynegotiating favorable treaty terms and arranging prestigious marriages for eachof his children. Keenly aware of his family's distinguished pedigree, he tookevery opportunity to enhance his own prestige, and became known as "princeof the fatherland" in Flemish texts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The eleventh-century chronicler William of Poitiers wasapparently in some awe of Baldwin V, describing him as "a man of greatpower who towered above the rest" and "this wisest of men."According to his account, "Counts, marquises, dukes, even archbishops ofthe highest dignity were struck dumb with admiration whenever the duty of theiroffice earned them the presence of this distinguished guest...Kings too reveredand stood in awe of his greatness." William of Malmesbury, whose GestaRegum Anglorum (The Deeds of the Kings of the English) was completed in around1125, was no less impressed, but he paints a rather more benevolent picture of"a man admirable alike for loyalty and wisdom, grey-haired yet with thevigour of youth, and of exalted position as husband of the king's sister."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The growth of Flanders's status, and that of Baldwin,ensured that Matilda enjoyed a privileged upbringing. Most of her childhood wasspent at the comital palace in Bruges, which was by now the foremost city inthe principality, Baldwin V having rebuilt and "greatly beautified"it as an expression of his dynasty's growing status. Bruges was immensely rich,having evolved into a thriving center of commerce. This lent it a cosmopolitanatmosphere, with traders from across the globe converging upon the city. Onecontemporary visitor observed that it "enjoys very great fame for thenumber of its merchants and for its affluence in all things upon which mankindplaces the greatest value." Matilda and her family also regularly stayedat Lille, Ghent, Th�rouanne, and the coastal town of St.-Omer, where herfather's court met on "special days" such as religious festivals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matilda's upbringing was superintended by her mother. Assuch, she had a powerful female role model from her very earliest days. Eventhough women were assigned the inferior role in marriage, politics, and societyin general, Adela's relationship with Count Baldwin was a marriage of equals.Not for her the traditional duties of a consort, which were confined toproducing heirs and leading a godly life. Instead she played an active part inthe government of Flanders, and her name appears in more than half of thecharters that were issued during her husband's reign. In many of these she wasstyled as the "sister of the king of France," an indication of the samepride in her ancestry that she would pass on to her daughter. Few of her peersenjoyed such prominence in the political life of their kingdoms, and it is rareto find a consort's name on more than a handful of legal documents: Adela'scontemporaries were obviously aware of her connections. The biography of QueenEmma of England, who was well acquainted with Adela, claimed that her namemeant "most noble," and it was careful to describe her as the"daughter of Robert, king of the French."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was by no means unusual that Adela should superviseMatilda's education. The role of the mother was seen as paramount in thisrespect throughout the medieval period. A ninth-century account praised KingAlfred's mother, Osburgh, "a religious woman, noble by birth and nature,"who gave her two sons a book of Saxon poetry, saying, "Whichever of youshall the soonest learn this volume shall have it for his own." WhenAlfred triumphs over his brother, his mother "smiles withsatisfaction."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mothers were expected to attain a high standard oflearning themselves so that they might pass this on to their offspring. Despitebeing rarely praised by contemporary sources, it was in fact common at thistime for wives to exceed their husbands in intellect. The early eleventhcentury was one of the most enlightened periods in the education of women, whenit was taken every bit as seriously as-and often more seriously than-that oftheir male counterparts. Daughters were encouraged to spend their leisure timecultivating their knowledge through reading, while sons would undertake moreactive pursuits such as hunting and training for warfare. Royal women, inparticular, tended to be better educated than men. Even though many others weretaught little else but how to read the psalter and sign their name, this wasmore than most laymen were capable of.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The relative enlightenment of the period is proved bycomparing it with the later Middle Ages, when the entire emphasis of a woman'seducation seemed to be upon how she might best serve her future husband.

Dispatched to Hong Kong to halt a series of violent incidents that threaten the Crown Colony's mid-1997 return to the People's Republic of China, Bond first checks on Guy Thackeray, the fifth- generation head of a family shipping firm called EurAsia Enterprises. Although the SIS troubleshooter gets the goods on the shady businessman, the latter perishes (or appears to) in a car bombing. In next trying to tap underworld intelligence sources, 007 makes a nearly fatal mistake and is obliged to undertake a personal mission for triad chieftain Li Xu Nan. Against the odds, the master spy penetrates the PRC and returns alive, bearing papers that put Li in his debt. With help from the grateful crime boss, Bond heads down under to investigate a mysterious outback blast London has told him is not his affair. In due course, he finds a back-from- the-dead Thackeray at a remote uranium mine; to his horror, he learns that the embittered taipan (who's used EurAsia to make a great fortune in the drug trade) plans to put paid to the celebration of Hong Kong's handover by detonating a crude nuclear device on or near the island at midnight on June 30, 1997.

He was professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Geneva, Lord Weidenfeld Professor of Comparative Literature and Fellow of St Anne's College at Oxford University, and Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University.In this dense, prolix book, critic, linguist, novelist, polymath Steiner holds that in the creation of art (especially music), and in its experiencing, there is a fundamental encounter with a "real presence" and that, in fact, it is this transcendent reality that grounds all genuine art and human communication. He does not so much argue this in the traditional manner as give a "transcendental argument" a la Kant: since so much literature and so many literary figures attest to the thesis, it must be true. Because of its lack of discursive argument, this difficult book will be dissatisfying to philosophers and largely impenetrable to the general reader.

Brimming with keen insights, <i>Thomas Jefferson &#x2015; Revolutionary</i> focuses on Jefferson&#x2019;s often radical views on federalism, the rights of conscience, race, slavery, and public education, casting light on the great political controversies that have long roiled the republic." - Daniel L.

It is time for a spirited corrective to this folly, and Kevin Gutzman has provided one in this book, reminding us of Jefferson&#x2019;s astounding range of accomplishments, and his steadfast confidence in the dignity and unrealized potential in the minds and hearts of ordinary people.

As David J. Silbey demonstrates in this taut, compelling history, the 1899 Philippine-American War was in fact all of these. Played out over three distinct conflicts--one fought between the Spanish and the allied United States and Filipino forces; one fought between the United States and the Philippine Army of Liberation; and one fought between occupying American troops and an insurgent alliance of often divided Filipinos--the war marked America's first steps as a global power and produced a wealth of lessons learned and forgotten. <br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>A War of Frontier and Empire</i>, Silbey traces the rise and fall of President Emilio Aguinaldo, as Aguinaldo tries to liberate the Philippines from colonial rule only to fail, devastatingly, before a relentless American army. He tracks President McKinley's decision to commit troops and fulfill a divinely inspired injunction to "uplift and civilize" despite the protests of many Americans. Most important, Silbey provides a clear lens to view the Philippines as, in the crucible of war, it transforms itself from a territory divided by race, ethnicity, and warring clans into a cohesive nation on the path to independence.</p><p>David J. Silbey is an assistant professor of European history at Alvernia College in Reading, Pennsylvania.Chapter OneA WAR OF FRONTIER AND EMPIREA SummitPresident Emilio Aguinaldo sat beneath a mountain one December day of 1899 and wondered what had happened to his revolution. More than a year before, he had been the head of an Army of Liberation which controlled the great majority of the Philippine Islands. The Filipinos of that army had swept aside their centuries-long imperial overlord, the Spanish. All that remained for them was to take the capital city of Manila and declare themselves an independent republic.Manila did fall, but not to the Filipinos. Instead, a force of Americans won a series of shattering naval and military battles, captured Manila from under the noses of the revolutionary army, and then had the temerity to buy the islands from the Spanish crown. What the Filipinos had paid for in blood, the Americans had paid for with gold.Aguinaldo found to his sorrow that he could do little to prevent it. The follow-on conflict between the Americans and the Filipinos had run almost entirely the Americans&#39; way. Filipino defeat had been so stunning and complete that Aguinaldo had been forced to dissolve his government and army in mid-November 1899 and flee into hiding, hoping to reconstitute his forces as a guerrilla army and shadow republic.He could not even guarantee his own safety. Fleeing the central plains of Luzon in mid-November 1899, Aguinaldo was pursued by relentless American forces who were not stopped even by the near-total sacrifice of a Filipino rearguard. His bolthole, in the northern valleys, had been surrendered by a treacherous general. So now Aguinaldo, in mid-December, sat in the small settlement of Banane on the slope of Mount Polis and wondered what he should do. He could not stay there. The Americans were likely to catch up soon; in any case, Banane was inhabited by the Igorots, tribal warriors of uncertain loyalties. Aguinaldo and his escort had been greeted when they arrived by the kanao, an Igorot ceremony celebrating the taking of a trophy: the head, hands, and feet of an enemy. Whether the Igorots intended this as a warning is not clear, but Aguinaldo certainly took it as one. He and his sister, one of a number of women accompanying the group, wistfully discussed traveling in Europe once the war was over. Such fantasies, however, did nothing for the short term.Thus, on the night of December 16, in a grove near his camp, Aguinaldo called a council of war. He and his officers and political associates discussed what to do. The discus-sion was reluctant and difficult, with several officers refusing to give their opinion and preferring simply to follow Aguinaldo&#39;s lead. Aguinaldo himself remained cagey. Finally, Simeon Villa, one of his medical officers, spoke up and suggested that the group &#34;should separate from the women, who constitute such a great impediment or obstacle to any plan,&#34; and continue deeper into the mountainous highlands to find a place to hide and continue the fight. To this Aguinaldo agreed, and so committed himself to going on with the war, hoping that conventional defeat might be followed by irregular victory. He left behind family, friends, and allies to wage this guerrilla war, one that would last a further two years. That decision would not bring the Filipinos victory, but Aguinaldo would live to see the day that independence came to the islands, and know that it had in some small way originated in the efforts of the 1890s.1Geography and ColonizationThe geography of the Philippines imposes a sense of disconnectedness. Thousands of islands, roughly sprinkled through the western Pacific, make up the archipelago. The distances between the islands vary from a few hundred yards to many miles. It is possible to swim easily from Leyte to Samar, while Palawan sits by itself to the west, stretching for hundreds of miles into the Sulu Sea. At their farthest south the Philippines reach within a few dozen miles of the island of Borneo. At their northernmost limit the islands come close to Taiwan. To the west is the South China Sea, surrounded in the late nineteenth century by the colonial outposts of a range of European powers: French Indochina due west, British Hong Kong northwest, and the Dutch East Indies southwest. And looming over all was the massive, ponderous, and decayed Chinese empire, home to hundreds of millions and bloated by centuries of lacquered ritual. By the turn of the century China was less a nation than a prize: a target that every major power eyed with anticipation.To the east was the Philippine Sea, an open swath of ocean bounded by New Guinea on the south, a necklace of small islands farther east, and, to the north, Japan. By the last few decades of the nineteenth century, the power of newly industrialized Japan was becoming apparent. The Japanese had not yet had their coming-out party, the moment they stepped onto the world stage and announced themselves as a power of substance. That would come a few years later in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905.In the middle of all this was the sleepy Spanish colony of the Philippines. Imperial Spain had acquired the islands centuries before, during the burst of exploration that marked the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Magellan had planted the Spanish flag there in 1521, and had planted himself as well, after an ill-considered meeting with hostile natives. Only one of Magellan&#39;s ships returned, captained by his first mate, Juan Sebasti�n de Elcano, who made it home, but, somewhat unfairly, not into historical memory. The Spanish were not the first outsiders to visit the Philippines. Certainly the great Chinese fleets of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries had stopped by. And Muslim explorers had broken out of the Indian Ocean even earlier, settling in some of the southern islands. But only the Spanish came to stay throughout the archipelago. In the 1560s, led by Don Miguel L�pez de Legazpi, who became the first governor and captain-general of the islands, they arrived in force, aggressive, imperialistic, and awash in the gold and silver of Central America.Spanish overlordship of the Philippines was more benign than their control of Central America. Critically, without silver and gold to mine, the Spanish had less need of slave labor to work to death in the dark underground. Instead, the Philippines, and the city of Manila in particular, served as the primary trading hub for the Spanish in the Pacific. They shipped silver from Mexico to Manila every year--the Pacific counterpart to the famous Atlantic flota that so obsessed pirates and privateers like Sir Francis Drake in the sixteenth century. From China came junks carrying silk and other precious items. The two met in Manila, and there the goods were exchanged for the enrichment of both sides.The Spanish brought with them a well-established body of law to organize and run the colonies, developed in the hard laboratory of Central America. Governors-general of the islands were, for the first few centuries, experienced men from either the Americas or from Spanish Flanders. The result was a thriving and sophisticated economy in the Philippines, a fierce trade rivalry with Portuguese merchants based at the Chinese port of Macao, and, not least, a growing Chinese population in the Philippines.2 It would not be the last time that the importance of the Philippines was seen largely for its relationship with China.The Spanish also brought with them a structured set of economic relationships, based on the domination of a Spanish elite, and a series of client-patron relations that would characterize the Philippines for centuries to come. People defined themselves in a complicated web of social networks in which a relatively small number of wealthy Spanish held the allegiance of hundreds if not thousands of both Spaniards and Filipinos. To call these relationships landlord-tenant would be to oversimplify desperately. The client-patron relationship might include landlordism and tenantship, but it was rarely limited to mere geographical allegiance. Clients looked to their patrons for a whole range of economic, social, and cultural protections, and patrons looked to their clients for corresponding services.Catholicism and EmpireBut perhaps the most critical European import was Ca-tholicism, and all the trappings of that church: priests, the Latin Mass, and the Inquisition. The lack of Spanish government interest in anything outside of Manila left the field open for the clergy, and the Catholic church--fired with the energies of the Counter-Reformation--soon developed an extensive network throughout the Philippines that, unlike almost anywhere else in Asia, converted a substantial majority of the populace to Catholicism. Many Filipinos might see no Spaniard but a friar for their entire lives. The conversions were long-lasting but not universal. Though the populations of the northern islands largely became Catholic, many in the southern islands remained true to their first conversion, to Islam.This reliance on the church for governing most of the Philippines had, however, an interesting side effect. Conversion was accomplished in the native dialects while masses were in Latin. The result was that, throughout Spanish control of the islands, the great majority of Filipinos never learned the tongue of the imperial motherland. A universal language was never imposed on the colony. The archipelago instead remained something of a Tower of Babel, with hundreds of groups speaking different dialects and unable, to a large extent, to understand one another.3Spanish power reached its height in the last half of the sixteenth century under King Philip II. But imperial Spain was--as happened so often with great powers--economically overstretched by its wars, its empire, and its appetites. Despite the massive influx of monies from the Central American mines, the Spanish throne went bankrupt a number of times during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The eighty-year revolution in the Spanish Netherlands, the Thirty Years&#39; War of 1618-48, and the rise of Dutch, En-glish, and, especially, French power doomed Spain to a long, slow slide from the top ranks.Her empire decayed along with her. The Thirty Years&#39; War, fought on a global scale against the Dutch, proved especially difficult for Spanish colonies.4 The Philippines themselves were taken briefly by the British in the middle of the eighteenth century, only to be handed back in a peace treaty, largely because the British were not interested in keeping them. The Central and South American colonies broke away in the first decades of the nineteenth century in a series of revolts that Spain could not prevent or defeat. Spanish Florida fell to the United States shortly thereafter. What was left of the empire by the late nineteenth century were remnants: islands scattered through the Caribbean, headlined by Cuba and Puerto Rico, and in the Pacific, the Philippines. Spain held them not by power but by indifference. None of the other great powers could be bothered to take them.Nor had the nineteenth century been kind to the Phil-ippines. The Industrial Revolution sweeping through the Western nations had made the Philippines into part of the global hinterland that fed raw materials into the voracious factories of Europe. Unlike the previous few centuries, when the Philippines were largely shut off from the world economy, the demands of the Industrial Revolution levered the Philippine economy open. From the Philippines came the raw agricultural product needed by the factories and back to the Philippines went the manufactures of those factories. Manila, Iloilo, and Cebu became, by the end of the century, large trading ports through which most of the Philippine economic transactions took place.5The result was demographic upheaval, as populations shifted in adjustment to the new economy. Hundreds of thousands moved inland--most particularly into the great central plains of Luzon--to clear the land and turn it over to the production of agricultural goods like tobacco and abaca fiber, which could then be sold to industrial nations. This frontier, inland rather than westward, created a society that--oddly--resembled nothing so much as the American West. &#34;The Philippines had pioneers and wagon trains, cattle ranching and rustling, cowboys and bandits, railroad building. . . .&#34;6But the breakdown of traditional societal arrangements resulted in an increased number of mortality crises throughout the Philippines, in which death rates spiked because of disease, famine, and dislocation. The 1880s were a &#34;decade of death&#34; for the Philippines,7 and the 1890s were not much better. The province of the Batangas on the island of Luzon experienced a smallpox epidemic in 1889 and a cholera epidemic in 1890, and lost most of its coffee crops to disease in the first years of the 1890s. In addition, the cattle disease rinderpest killed thousands of water buffalo, the main domestic farm animal of the Philippines.8The result was a society in economic and social flux in the 1880s and 1890s. The Spanish government contributed to this social instability by first appointing a series of reforming governors from 1880 to 1888 who opened up Philippine society and allowed limited political and cultural freedom, and then appointing the reactionary Gen. Valeriano Weyler to the governorship from 1888 to 1891, who undid the reforms, embittering many Filipinos.9RevolutionThis was the situation when the last decade of the nineteenth century opened. A declining Spanish monarchy, its gaze turned inward to past glories, ruled over a Philippines riven by demographic and economic difficulties. It should not come as a surprise that something approaching a revolution began. What started was less an organized attempt to throw off Spanish rule than an effort of different groups to shape violently the unsteady social order around them.To understand the revolution, we must understand the racial divisions within Philippine society. At the top were the peninsulares, Spaniards born in Spain. Below them were insulares (also simply called Filipinos), Spaniards born in the Philippines. Below them, far below them, were the indios, non-Spanish native-born Filipinos. The Spanish--peninsulare and insulare--dominated the Philippine society and economy. The indios--even the term had racist connotations--were forever ruled rather than rulers: &#34;The monkey will always be a monkey however you dress him with shirt and trousers,&#34; was one friar&#39;s summation in 1885.10But things began to shift slightly in the last part of the nineteenth century. Upper-class Filipinos (insulares) began to send their children abroad to be educated in Europe. This group came to be known as ilustrados. Among them was a young Filipino named Jos� Rizal. In 1889 Rizal and his friends were touring Europe where they went to see the Paris Exposition of that year. At the Exposition they saw a Wild West show, which included Native American performers on horseback. Struck by the daring and popularity of the performers, Rizal and his friends decided to form an association for Filipinos to assert their own identity, to make themselves &#34;braves&#34; on the American Indian model. Los Indios Bravos, they called it, a spectacular entangling of Spanish and American themes and ideas.Rizal positioned his group not as one grasping to elevate itself to the level of the Spanish-born elite, but as one seeking common cause with the indio. The group explicitly denied the ...</p><h2>Nudes</h2><p>A study of nudes from award-winning photographer Lee Friedlander.</p><p></p><h2>Lazarus Book 1</h2><p>&#x201c;Lark's artwork is fabulous, capturing both the scenes of violence and those of introspection, in which Forever tries to accept who she is and how she feels about it.

What is remarkable is that there is no accessible guide for how to write one. Now, following his recent <i>Biography: A Brief History</i> (from Harvard), award-winning biographer and teacher Nigel Hamilton tackles the practicalities of doing biography in this first succinct primer to elucidate the tools of the biographer&#x2019;s craft. </p><p> </p><p> Hamilton invites the reader to join him on a fascinating journey through the art of biographical composition. Starting with personal motivation, he charts the making of a modern biography from the inside: from conception to fulfillment. He emphasizes the need to know one&#x2019;s audience, rehearses the excitement and perils of modern research, delves into the secrets of good and great biography, and guides the reader through the essential components of life narrative. </p><p> </p><p> With examples taken from the finest modern biographies, Hamilton shows how to portray the ages of man&#x2014;birth, childhood, love, life&#x2019;s work, the evening of life, and death. In addition, he suggests effective ways to start and close a life story. He clarifies the difference between autobiography and memoir&#x2014;and addresses the sometimes awkward ethical, legal, and personal consequences of truth-telling in modern life writing. He concludes with the publication and reception of biography&#x2014;its afterlife, so to speak. </p><p> </p><p> Written with humor, insight, and compassion, <i>How To Do Biography</i> is the manual that would-be biographers have long been awaiting. </p></p><p>Nigel Hamilton is the author of prize-winning biographies of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and of John F. Kennedy. He is currently a Senior Fellow of the John W. McCormack Graduate School of Policy and Global Studies at the University of Massachusetts, Boston.This marvelous work--basically, a how-to book--is comprehensive in its treatment of everything necessary to creating a published biography. Hamilton, who has authored biographies of Field Marshall Montgomery, John F. Kennedy, and Bill Clinton, here leaves nothing unsaid on the subject. He thoroughly details biography's agenda and motivation and describes its target audience, who will expect something of a revelation concerning the human condition...He additionally scrutinizes autobiography and memoir writing, the consequence of telling the truth, and biography's afterlife. The exceptional excerpts Hamilton selects from published biographies to illustrate his points are both edifying and entertaining. (Robert Kelly <i>Library Journal</i> 2008-04-15)<br><br>Drawing instruction from his own lifetime of biographic work and others'--including Samuel Johnson, Robert Caro, David McCullough, Hermione Lee, Edmund Morris, and others whom Hamilton has admired, known and worked with--the author takes readers on an intellectual journey through the creative process, from conception to publishing...Hamilton's passion, lyricism and collection of telling anecdotes make this "short book of advice" an unexpected page-turner; it's hard not to get caught up in the author's romantic vision of biography, a form he believes has nearly as many permutations as music. Elucidating not just the dos and don'ts of biography, but also the whys and hows, Hamilton has created a motivating, empowering guide for writers (and fans) of the genre. (<i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i> 2008-05-05)<br><br>No one writing biography can afford to ignore this edifying book. Nigel Hamilton has the depth and breadth of experience to write about a genre that he champions...While this is a &#x201c;how-to&#x201d; book, even the most seasoned biographer will find much of value about choosing a subject; doing proposals for biographies; handling interviewing; negotiating the perils of publishing unauthorized biographies; managing biographical narratives; writing with an audience in mind; and the nexus between memoir, autobiography, and biography.

He updates his prior writing about the nature of depression as a destructive illness and the effect of antidepressants on traits like low self-worth.

[Kramer] has done some much-needed synthesizing and debunking . . . his dissections of the most incendiary studies are careful, and his conclusions<b>&#x2015;</b>that they overestimate placebo effects and underestimate the potency of antidepressants<b>&#x2015;</b>will invite a reckoning of some kind . . . his 'interludes' describing his own experience treating patients . . . are beautiful, philosophical, ambivalent." <b>&#x2015;Jennifer Senior, <i>The New York Times</i> </b></p><p>"<i>Ordinarily Well</i> is an ambitious, persuasive, and important book . . . [Kramer] doesn&#x2019;t just make a case for antidepressants.He makes a case for psychiatry itself as a humanistic science . . . Kramer is an excellent guide as he subjects evidence-based purism . . . to the scrutiny he believes it needs . . . Kramer also works in a courteous fashion, respectful of his opponents and his readers, in whose patience and capacity for reason he places great faith." <b>&#x2015;</b><b>Jonathan Rosen,<i> The Atlantic </i></b></p><p>"Careful and measured and fair . . . Kramer evinces such humility that no one could accuse him of being a promedication ideologue . . . Kramer is out to win the 'antidepressant wars' in favor of the antidepressants. Is he right? . . . in my judgment he is . . . You will most likely come away convinced by his argument for the efficacy of antidepressants<b>&#x2015;</b>and moved by his humane concern for his patients, and for the needless suffering of unmedicated patients around the world." <b>&#x2015;</b><b>Scott Stossel, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><p>"Offers a carefully argued and convincing case that antidepressants not only work but also are an essential tool in the treatment of depression . . .

Antidepressants, he says, have given many patients back their lives, and some of these anecdotes are quite moving . . . [Kramer] comes across as modest and self-deprecatory, and giants such as Gerald Klerman, the onetime dean of American psychiatry, spring to life in these pages." <b>&#x2015;Edward Shorter, <i>The Washington Post</i></b></p><p>"[<i>Ordinarily Well</i>] seeks to restore public confidence in antidepressants through a combination of reporting, research analysis and [Kramer's] own experience with patients . . . it is certainly an important [read] for those who seek help for depression and the providers who treat them." <b>&#x2015;</b><b>Damon Tweedy, <i>Chicago Tribune </i></b></p><p>"Peter D. Kramer provides a forceful rejoinder to this growing tide of skepticism [toward antidepressants]. Kramer has been a prominent voice on matters of mental health for some time . . .

After more than 20 years [since <i>Listening To Prozac</i>], Kramer wants to address properly what he thinks is a potentially dangerous level of ignorance and confusion about antidepressants . . .

Despite the complexity of the topic and the breadth of his research reviews, Dr. Kramer tells the story of antidepressant research in a way that a lay reader can follow . . . The complexities are explained without medical lingo and, in the end, he concludes what psychiatrists see every day: Antidepressants work." <b>&#x2015;Dinah Miller, <i>Clinical Psychiatry News</i></b></p><p>"Kramer mounts a comprehensive, spirited, and completely convincing defense [of antidepressants], dispelling any doubts about their efficacy and life-changing capability . . .

Case closed." <b>&#x2015;</b><b>Tony Miksanek, <i>Booklist </i>(starred review)</b></p><p>"I have always loved Peter Kramer's writing for the reflective way he weds his own practice and personal experiences with extant science to lead us to new and profound insights into the psyche. <i>Listening to Prozac</i> exemplified his ability to define a new paradigm. In <i>Ordinarily Well</i>, he brings a lifetime of treating patients to a consideration of antidepressants, looking carefully at the nature of evidence. The work of one of the few voices out there without ties to industry, this reasoned and beautifully written narrative is another breakthrough, one that brings us to a new and humane understanding of depression and its treatment." <b>&#x2015;Abraham Verghese, author of <i>Cutting For Stone</i></b></p><p>"In previous books, Peter Kramer has been an insightful clinician, a sensitive novelist, and a social critic. Here he is a thoughtful teacher. Using both the scientific literature and the lived experience of his own patients, he explains brilliantly the evidence supporting the use of antidepressants. As he notes, depression is a serious, life-threatening illness. Antidepressants work, keeping depression at bay. For some they are not sufficient. And for an unfortunate few, they are not effective. But remembering the hopeless state of treatment only a few decades ago, Kramer reminds us with compelling prose and compassionate insight that today millions of us are much better off with access to these medications." <b>&#x2015;Thomas R.

First, he showed the world the potentially transformative efficacy of antidepressants in <i>Listening to Prozac</i>. Now, in <i>Ordinarily Well</i>, Kramer dissects the controversy and misinformation about the effectiveness of antidepressants with impressive clarity and fairness. Kramer is a masterful teacher and clinician who gives readers a rare gift: an insider's understanding of this complex subject, including statistics and the design of clinical trials. Anyone who wants to know the truth about antidepressants should read this book." <b>&#x2015;Richard A. Friedman, M.D., Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College and contributing Op-Ed writer for <i>The New York Times</i></b><br><b></b><br>"In this provocative and personal book, Kramer begins with the premise that he speaks in the voice of 'clinician as sinner.' For Kramer, the clinician's sin is to complicate the simpler story told by the randomized trials, the clerical voice in drug research. He makes the case that the studies need the narrative and the narratives need the studies. We have taken sides in a culture war in psychiatry that we can&#x2019;t afford. Patients' well-being, indeed their very lives, depend on a declaration of peace. <i>Ordinarily Well </i>makes a compelling case for humility. Sometimes medications work but imperfectly or they work for a while but need to be changed. And sometimes they work when supplemented by the insight that only conversation can provide." <b>&#x2015;Sherry Turkle, Professor of the Social Studies of Science, MIT, and author of <i>Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age</i> and <i>Alone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less from Each Other</i></b><br><b></b><br>"For anyone with depression or anyone who loves someone struggling with it, this book is essential. It's cutting edge psychiatry at its best&#x2015;all the important questions, data, and controversy surrounding antidepressant treatment made crystal clear. Dr. Kramer is one of the rare experts who is, at once, analytically astute, vastly knowledgeable, clinically experienced, and personally very wise." <b>&#x2015;Sally Satel, M.D., Yale University, and coauthor of <i>Brainwashed: The Seductive Appeal of Mindless Neuroscience</i></b><br><b></b><br>"Biological psychiatry has shown that depression&#x2015;poetically called 'malignant sadness'&#x2015;is as biologically 'real' as cancer (or any other disease). This is most apparent when a drug changes the patient's neurochemistry and, with greater than chance frequency, the darkness lifts. Nonetheless, the value of antidepressants has been questioned in both scientific and pseudo-scientific circles. In <i>Ordinarily Well</i>, Peter Kramer, arguably the wisest clinician thinking and writing about depression, emphatically supports the efficacy of using antidepressants in the right place and time. Given the pandemic of malignant sadness that we face, this is a deeply important book." <b>&#x2015;Robert Sapolsky, professor of biological sciences and of neurological sciences and neurology at Stanford University</b></p><p>"<i>Ordinarily Well</i> is vintage Peter D. Kramer: compassionate, thoughtful, provocative.

And nowhere in America is this tradition more evocative and venerable than in New York and New England, where Dutch, English, French, and Scotch settlers created an extraordinary legacy of simple one- and two-story structures dating from the seventeenth century.<br><br>The houses portrayed here -- forthright, sturdy, and built by carpenters and masons rather than architects -- stand as enduring tributes to pragmatic, handcrafted design and the resourceful use of local, natural materials. They also stand as cherished, comfort-giving homes to current generations of owners, many of whom have sensitively adapted them for life in the twenty-first century.<br><br>With striking color photography by Trevor Tondro and insightful text by William Morgan, this book documents 19 outstanding examples of this folk idiom. The structures featured here were built over the course of a century of American history, with each property expressing its own personality through regional traditions, period styles, building materials, and the imprint of caretakers past and present. While the style of these farmhouses show wonderful diversity, they are all eloquent meditations on a common theme: the intrinsic beauty and value of that which is old and true.<br><br>A Simpler Way of Life is a book for architects, designers, historians, preservationists, and anyone who wishes to learn more about this classic American genre. This volume is a compelling reminder that the old, honest country house is not only as inviting and beautiful as the grandest of homes, but is endowed with a grace and humanity unmatched by any other form of domestic architecture.</p><p>William Morgan writes on American architecture, historic and contemporary. His many books include The Cape Cod Cottage and American Country Churches. Monadnock Summer, his recent study of the architecture of Dublin, New Hampshire, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.<br><br>Trevor Tondro has been dedicated to architectural photography since living and working in Latin America and France. His work has appeared in Architectural Record, House Beautiful, and Interior Design magazines in addition to The New York Times.A Simpler Way of Life is an eloquent witness for a living, breathing preservation. The houses portrayed here are quiet and colorful, beautiful and rough, spacious and inviting- a testament to the author's stewardship of the real. --Howard Mansfield, author of Dwelling in Possibility: Searching for the Soul of Shelter and In the Memory House<br><br>Graceful prose by William Morgan and sumptuous photography by Trevor Tondro have captured the spirit of these durable, time-worn farmsteads, while also showing us what thoughtful, respectful restoration looks like in the back-country landscape of the American Northeast. --Robert P. Emlen, author of Shaker Village Views and senior lecturer in American studies, Brown University<br><br>The stunning photographs and appealing text of A Simpler Way of Life present a diverse portfolio of early farmhouses in New York and New England and their sensitive and gentle adaptation for modern living. It is an unusual and welcome contribution to our literature on America's historic architecture. --Richard Guy Wilson, Commonwealth professor and chair, department of architectural history, University of Virginia</p><h2>Pandamonia</h2><p><p>Here&#x2019;s something to remember: when visiting the zoo, whatever you do, DON&#x2019;T WAKE THE PANDA!

He loved Roman republicanism, but saw himself as too principled for the mere politics that might have saved it. His life and lessons are urgently relevant in the harshly divided America&#x2015;and world&#x2015;of today. With erudition and verve, Rob Goodman and Jimmy Soni turn their life of Cato into the most modern of biographies, <b>a blend of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and Game Change</b>."&#x2015;Howard Fineman, Editorial Director of The Huffington Post Media Group, NBC and MSNBC News Analyst, and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Thirteen American Arguments</i> </p><p>"<b>A truly outstanding piece of work.</b> What most impresses me is the book's ability to reach through the confusing dynastic politics of the late Roman Republic to present social realities in a way intelligible to the modern reader. <i>Rome's Last Citizen</i> entertainingly restores to life the stoic Roman who inspired George Washington, Patrick Henry and Nathan Hale. This is more than a biography: it is a study of how a reputation lasted through the centuries from the end of one republic to the start of another."&#x2015;David Frum, <i>DailyBeast</i> columnist, former White House speech writer, and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Right Man</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>Marcus Porcius Cato: aristocrat who walked barefoot and slept on the ground with his troops, political heavyweight who cultivated the image of a Stoic philosopher, a hardnosed defender of tradition who presented himself as a man out of the sacred Roman past&#x2015;and the last man standing when Rome's Republic fell to tyranny. His blood feud with Caesar began in the chamber of the Senate, played out on the battlefields of a world war, and ended when he took his own life rather than live under a dictator.</p><p>Centuries of thinkers, writers, and artists have drawn inspiration from Cato's Stoic courage. Saint Augustine and the early Christians were moved and challenged by his example. Dante, in his <i>Divine Comedy</i><i>,</i> chose Cato to preside over the souls who arrive in Purgatory. George Washington so revered him that he staged a play on Cato's life to revive the spirit of his troops at Valley Forge. Now, in <i>Rome's Last Citizen</i><i>,</i> Rob Goodman and Jimmy Soni deliver the first modern biography of this stirring figure.</p><p>Cato's life is a gripping tale that resonates deeply with our own turbulent times. He grappled with terrorists, a debt crisis, endemic political corruption, and a huge gulf between the elites and those they governed. In many ways, Cato was the ultimate man of principle&#x2015;he even chose suicide rather than be used by Caesar as a political pawn. But Cato was also a political failure: his stubbornness sealed his and Rome's defeat, and his lonely end casts a shadow on the recurring hope that a singular leader can transcend the dirty business of politics.</p><p><i>Rome's Last Citizen</i> is a timeless story of an uncompromising man in a time of crisis and his lifelong battle to save the Republic.</p></p><p>ROB GOODMAN has worked as the speechwriter for House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Senator Chris Dodd.

The man dangling and shaking him out over the ground, intermittently threatening to drop him, is a stranger. He is Pompaedius Silo, an Italian politician visiting from out of town, a friend of Cato&#x2019;s uncle and guardian. He is in Rome to plead once more for citizenship for the towns of Italy, Rome&#x2019;s &#x201c;allies.&#x201d;<br>Pompaedius was evidently the kind of single-minded reformer who couldn&#x2019;t let the cause go even when playing with children. He&#x2019;d asked the boys of the house, with a smile, &#x201c;Come, beg your uncle to help us in our struggle.&#x201d; Though they barely understood the request, all of them, even Cato&#x2019;s half brother, had nodded yes. Cato had only stared.<br>There came another request for help, then a joke, then the guest&#x2019;s dropped smile, then threats, and still the angry stare from this four-year-old boy either dumb or self-possessed beyond his years, until he was shaken and dangled out the window&#x2014;without a scream, without a cry for help, yielding just that same unblinking stare.<br>After Pompaedius gave up and set the boy back on his feet, he was overheard to say, &#x201c;How lucky for Italy that he is a boy; if he were a man, I don&#x2019;t think we could get a single vote.&#x201d;<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>It is the kind of perfect story that could only come from a culture that didn&#x2019;t believe in childhood. The truth is that we know precious little about the boy Cato, or the boy Caesar, or the boy Cicero. Most of the details of their childhoods, or any Roman childhood, were considered too trivial to remember. And when their stories do come down to us&#x2014;like the story of Cato and the window, told by Plutarch about a hundred years after the fact&#x2014;they are the stories of little adults. We talk about &#x201c;formative&#x201d; years, but in childhood stories like this one, it is as if the Romans were born fully formed.<br>Whether or not there was an authentic incident of a houseguest, a political controversy, and a children&#x2019;s game turned violent, this is, at the very least, a projection back into boyhood of all the indelible qualities of the grown Cato: stubbornness (or obstinacy); fearlessness (or foolhardiness); traditionalist politics (or reactionary politics). The story shows Cato grabbed by an overwhelming force, facing death, and evincing utter calm in the face of it. It shows him proving so unshakable that the force, while remaining every bit as overwhelming, recognizes that it has suffered some kind of moral defeat. Plutarch was a deliberate artist: He started Cato&#x2019;s life with a typology of his death.<br>What else do we know of Cato&#x2019;s beginnings? We know he was born in 95 to his mother Livia Drusa and father Marcus Cato, a senator of whom little record survives. The conventions of Roman childhood and parenting are well understood in outline, though we know little unique to Cato. If the first moments of his life were at all typical, the screaming newborn Cato was placed at the feet of his father. His father raised him from the ground, held him close, inspected him for signs of strength and health&#x2014;a tender gesture, but one that held the power of life and death. His father&#x2019;s nod made him a citizen and a son; rejected on the ground, he would have been marked a bastard and left to die. Several days&#x2019; wait, and he was given the name of his family&#x2019;s men for at least six generations: Marcus. Then came a series of rituals. The house was swept to rid it of evil spirits. A lucky golden locket was placed around the newborn&#x2019;s neck. His future was divined in the flight of birds and the entrails of sacrificed animals. All this signaled Cato&#x2019;s entrance into his father&#x2019;s household and family line.<br>Above all, of course, we know that Cato survived his earliest days&#x2014;no small feat in a culture that tested the toughness of newborns by exposing them to the elements, bathing them in ice water, and kneading the weakness out of their soft muscles. That there was not much weakness in Cato can be inferred from the simple fact that he lived.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Whether or not an enraged houseguest nearly defenestrated the boy Cato, what is indisputably true is the grievance the guest came to Rome to press. Italy hadn&#x2019;t always paid tribute to Rome: Its independence had been worn down over centuries of war. Even where Rome&#x2019;s authority was acknowledged, it was hardly welcomed. When Hannibal had marched over the Alps in 218, intent on conquering Rome, half of Italy had sided with him; when he was driven out, Rome punished the traitor cities severely, destroying some outright.<br>And yet, as Rome built an overseas empire, Italian soldiers shared the burden, manning up to two-thirds of the Roman army; Italian sons died alongside Romans to secure Sicily and Carthage and Greece. Romans and Italians were interchangeable to the conquered, indistinguishable <i>Romaioi</i>. Yet the spoils went overwhelmingly to the Roman capital, and Italians were denied the vote, even as they paid men and money into the Roman machine.<br>The Italian question had vexed Roman politics for generations, and it was a central theme in the brief careers of Rome&#x2019;s greatest radicals, the brothers Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus. Their failure is often considered the beginning of the Republic&#x2019;s slow end.<br>The oldest son of an old family, already decorated in war, Tiberius Gracchus is said to have conceived his political platform while on the march. A generation before Cato&#x2019;s birth, he was infuriated to see firsthand an Italian countryside almost entirely given over to imported slave gangs and the massive plantations of the Roman rich. He grieved that &#x201c;the Italian race&nbsp;... a people so valiant in war, and related in blood to the Romans, were declining little by little into pauperism and paucity of numbers without any hope of remedy.&#x201d; He also feared that Rome, with its hardy, small farmers on the decline, would grow increasingly vulnerable to its enemies.<br>In 133, soon after his return to Rome, Tiberius won election as tribune of the people. The Senate had set aside the office of the tribune as a pacifier for Rome&#x2019;s underclass, but it was rarely used for any radical purpose until Tiberius got his hands on it. He electrified Rome with his passionate words on behalf of the soldiers who fought to build an empire, even as their own small pieces of that empire were stripped away:<br>It is with lying lips that their commanders exhort the soldiers in their battles to defend sepulchres and shrines from the enemy; for not a man of them has an hereditary altar, not one of all these many Romans an ancestral tomb, but they fight and die to support others in wealth and luxury, and though they are styled masters of the world, they have not a single clod of earth that is their own.<br>On the strength of this rallying cry, Tiberius proposed to remedy Rome&#x2019;s wealth gap by capping the holdings of the rich and distributing public lands to the urban poor. Ignoring the outrage of Rome&#x2019;s senatorial establishment, Tiberius took his bill for land redistribution directly to the people&#x2019;s assembly, a body with the authority to pass laws, but one that rarely dared to defy the aristocracy. The Roman masses passed the land reform by acclamation.<br>In the Senate, Tiberius&#x2019;s success was perceived not merely as the action of a radical, but as the ambition of a would-be king, an attempt to put a faction in permanent power with the backing of the poor. Not long after passage of the land bill, a senator and neighbor of the Gracchus family was brought forward to testify that Tiberius was hiding a crown in his home. The Senate&#x2019;s suspicions seemed all but confirmed when Tiberius broke with Roman tradition and announced his campaign for a second consecutive year in office. It was only because he wanted immunity from political prosecution, he insisted. It was the first step to declaring himself tribune-for-life, his enemies said.<br>It is not surprising that the fracas ended in the murder of Tiberius and the death of his followers. What is astonishing is that the party of senators who beat Tiberius to death in open daylight was led by Rome&#x2019;s high priest, who wore his toga pulled over his head, just as he dressed when sacrificing an animal. The assassination of Tiberius was dressed up as a religious rite, a sacrifice to the Republic&#x2019;s guardian gods.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Tiberius&#x2019;s younger brother, Gaius Gracchus, escaped the killings&#x2014;and for the rest of his short life, &#x201c;the grief he had suffered encouraged him to speak out fearlessly.&#x201d; Friends and enemies alike painted Gaius as a man on fire for revenge. Yet, elected tribune ten years after Tiberius, he brought more than anger and grief to the work of coalition building and legislating. He brought a discipline that outdid his brother&#x2019;s. While Tiberius reached out to the Roman poor alone, Gaius made inroads with Rome&#x2019;s merchant class, the <i>equites</i> (so called because they could afford to outfit themselves with a horse in times of war). And in the most critical departure from his brother&#x2019;s example, Gaius invited Italians into his populist coalition. For the first time, a leading Roman was offering equal citizenship, including full voting rights, to Rome&#x2019;s closest Italian allies.<br>It was Gaius&#x2019;s most creative act of statesmanship&#x2014;but it was also the opening that allowed his conservative opponents a chance to destroy him. It took little effort to drive a wedge between Gaius&#x2019;s Italian and Roman backers: His opponents had only to point out that more voting power and more cheap bread for Italians meant less of both for Romans. &#x201c;If you give citizenship to the Latins,&#x201d; said one nativist...</p><h2>Simplified Magic: A Beginner&#39;s Guide to the New Age Quabala</h2><p><i>Simplified Magic</i> by Ted Andrews is the ideal beginning guide to learning the ancient art of catalyzing desired changes through knowledge and manipulation of energy.

But be forewarned - this is not a how-to book, nor a guide to secret places, though there is plenty of expertise and uncharted territory to be discovered here.Jack's season of a sportsman begins appropriately in the spring, at a dude ranch in Clark's Fork Valley, near the Yellowstone River. As an awkward six-year-old threading live grasshoppers on old, worn-out wet flies his father Ernest had discarded, Jack found his lifelong passion in much the same way his father had so many years earlier as a child on Walloon Lake in Michigan. His summer would bring steelhead on the North Umpqua, fishing with Papa's newly christened "Christ Pants" that enabled him to "walk on water," and looking for trout along the Danube in the aftermath of World War II. Fall brings expeditions to the steelhead-laden tributaries of the Snake River, fishing for Atlantic salmon, along with time for reflection and Jack's fervent belief that "there is always something new to learn."Balancing a self-effacing humor with a delicacy of prose both graceful and knowing, along with an introduction by Geoffrey Norman and a foreword contributed by Angela Hemingway, A Life Worth Living is a touching memoir of a lifetime spent practicing the sport he and his father both loved so much.

Muir is a printmaker and freelance writer. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p><i>Printmaking in the Sun</i> introduces a revolutionary new printmaking technique known as the solarplate method, first developed in 1972 by one of the book's authors, Dan Welden. He had begun experimenting with light-sensitive polymer plates in place of traditional metal plates, which frees the artist from exposure to poisonous lead fumes. To make a solarplate print, one creates a piece of artwork on film, overlays it on a solarplate, and exposes the film and plate together in the sun. The drawing is transferred to the plate, which is then developed in ordinary tap water. The resulting image appears in the same orientation as the original drawing. This book exhaustively covers the techniques of solarplate printing, describing how to use the proper equipment and materials, prepare relief and intaglio images, make and print relief and intaglio plates, expose your work to the sun, use digital images and photogravure, and work with color printing. The book is generously illustrated with color and black-and-white solarplate images by accomplished artists, as well as clear step-by-step illustrations depicting how to prepare and process your images and plates. The book also contains a comprehensive glossary, selected further reading, and list of suppliers in the United States and Australia. The innovative techniques described in <i>Printmaking in the Sun</i> form an enormous resource of versatile, imaginative applications. Artists of all levels will appreciate the fluidity of creative expression inherent in such a simple and immediate process. <i>--Mary Ribesky</i>Dan Welden, the creator of the solarplate printing technique, is an artist and teacher who conducts workshops widely and directs Hampton Editions Ltd., located in Sag Harbor, New York.

These protests, and others like them in cities across the country, resulted in the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement. Now, in his first book, Mckesson lays down the intellectual, pragmatic, and political framework for a new liberation movement. Continuing a conversation about activism, resistance, and justice that embraces our nation's complex history, he dissects how deliberate oppression persists, how racial injustice strips our lives of promise, and how technology has added a new dimension to mass action and social change. He argues that our best efforts to combat injustice have been stunted by the belief that racism's wounds are history, and suggests that intellectual purity has curtailed optimistic realism. The book offers a new framework and language for understanding the nature of oppression. With it, we can begin charting a course to dismantle the obvious and subtle structures that limit freedom.<br><br>Honest, courageous, and imaginative, <i>On the Other Side of Freedom</i> is a work brimming with hope. Drawing from his own experiences as an activist, organizer, educator, and public official, Mckesson exhorts all Americans to work to dismantle the legacy of racism and to imagine the best of what is possible. Honoring the voices of a new generation of activists, <i>On the Other Side of Freedom</i> is a visionary's call to take responsibility for imagining, and then building, the world we want to live in.</p><p>DeRay Mckesson is a civil rights activist, community organizer, and the host of Crooked Media's award-winning podcast, <i>Pod Save the People</i>.

At nine o'clock in the morning, twenty of us had filed in and plopped down in four rows in the center of the station. The police began to gather around us as hundreds of our fellow protesters turned the corner and were now standing outside the building demanding to get in. When it looked like the officers might forcibly remove us, everyone began to link arms-everyone but me. It was my role to record and interpret as much as possible everywhere we protested so that we could consistently tell the truth to the outside world. So I sat in the front of our stacked rows, unlinked.</p><p>I was trying to capture as much as I could on my phone and tweet about it in real time. I wanted to be able to tell the story of the only successful sit-in of a police department since the protests began. We were repeatedly told to move, and we refused. It wasn't long before the officers' growing impatience turned to action. I heard the screaming before I realized that we'd been completely surrounded. It all happened so fast. I looked over and saw a mother trying to stop an officer from driving his thumb into the pressure point behind her daughter's ear. And when I looked up, there was an officer standing directly over me. She told us that we needed to leave immediately. Again, we refused to move. And then she rested her hand on her Taser. I'll never forget how time stopped as I watched her move her hand from her waist to her Taser to her gun, almost like it happened in slow motion.</p><p>Suddenly, I was on my back, gliding across the industrial floor as an officer dragged me to the entrance of the building by my ankles. "Why are you doing this?" I asked, as a second officer twisted my arm behind my back. His face fell flat, like he snapped out of the hostility, and instead of a verbal reply, he just let my arm go, picked me up, and pushed me out the door.</p><p>It was one of two moments of late when death has felt near. And when death is near, so too is the question of how: How did I get myself into this situation? Should I have made a different choice?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I live off the beaten path in Baltimore City in a house that people don�t wander to. If you come to the house, you have made a decision to be at the house. I�ve been using ride-sharing apps since I totaled my car in the protests in October 2014, and I was using one on this day in 2017. I saw the car in the driveway, and I paused. But I was already home, so I felt like I had to get out of the car. And when I got out, the driver in the other car got out too. And in that moment, the calmness came over me, like it did in the St. Louis Metro Police Department.</p><p>I've received many death threats over the years, the FBI has visited my house, my phone has been hacked, cities have hired surveillance companies that have deemed me a serious threat, and a movie theater was evacuated because I received a threat that I'd be shot during a screening. But none of those things shook me like that day when the car was in front of the house after work.</p><p>The driver walked toward me, and I just stood still. I can't even say that I was afraid in that moment. I was still and focused, a stillness and focus that I've known only a few times. I followed his hands and body with my eyes, waiting. Ready. Anxious. He reached out his hand and gave me a packet of papers. I looked down and realized that I'd just been served with a lawsuit. I was sued personally by five police officers: three in Dallas and two from Baton Rouge. I hadn't been physically served in any of the lawsuits except this one, on the day the guy showed up in my driveway. After he handed me the papers he asked to take a photo, and with that, he was on his way.</p><p>These moments forced me to think about the "why" of this work, the fundamental question of whether it is worth the costs. But we all know the risks of protesting, and we choose to meet them head-on. There were so many times in the early months that I was met with an almost paralyzing fear, but as I watched the officer in the police station, I realized that, for what felt like the first time, I wasn't afraid.</p><p>It was in losing the fear of death that I began to understand faith and hope.</p><p>Faith is the belief that certain outcomes will happen and hope the belief that certain outcomes can happen. So when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. says, �The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice,� he is speaking from a place of faith. He is confident that justice is inevitable even if it may come in another lifetime. Faith is often rooted in the belief in a higher power, in God. Hope, on the other hand, would mean reframing this statement to say, �The arc of the moral universe is long, and it will bend toward justice if we bend it.� Faith is rooted in certainty; hope is rooted in possibility-and they both require their own different kinds of work.</p><p>The work of faith is to actively surrender to forces unseen, to acknowledge that what is desired will come about, but by means that you may never know, and this is difficult. That faith is rooted in certainty does not mean that it never wavers. Indeed, it is not a static belief but one based on trust. And one's trust is not easily conferred.</p><p>Hope is the belief that our tomorrows can be better than our todays. Hope is not magic; hope is work. I am not certain that a new world, one of equity and justice, will emerge, but I am certain that it can emerge. I have heard people speak of hope in rather different ways. The first is with statements like, "I hope that we win," or "I hope my loved one, diagnosed with incurable cancer, will somehow make it." When we hope in this way, we choose optimism. We believe that perhaps the seemingly extraordinary miracle is within our reach, that it is yet possible. At times, though, when we hope in this manner, we surrender our agency to luck or divine intervention. We acknowledge our limitations in impacting the eventual outcome and rest on optimism as our key act, the primary tool in our toolkit.</p><p>When we talk about being hopeful for a future in which black bodies are not considered weapons, it's so easy to deride hope as a platitude, or a nice thought, or even as an enemy of progress. Yet there's another side to hope. Hope can be a driving force. Consider the notion of hope in relation to the way that we use "dream"-a word with a similar dual use. On the one hand, a dream can be the fanciful whimsy of a child, free to explore any one of countless possible realities, completely unmoored from present-day circumstance. But dreams have another, more actionable meaning. Indeed, they can be a firm, dynamic vision of where you want to go. I think this is why we still celebrate the dream of Dr. King, and why parents urge their kids to dream.</p><p>Hope is the precursor to strategy. It powers our vision of what roles we must play in bringing about a desired goal, and it amplifies our efforts. I am not surrendering to luck. I am not surrendering to a blind faith that things will just get better. I am reminded that to have faith that a world of equity and justice will emerge does not relinquish one's role in helping it emerge. This is the way to use hope: as faith's companion (and vice versa). When my faith is challenged, it is the belief that things can change that keeps me moving forward. And when hope feels futile, I rely on faith to push forward and help reclaim that certainty.</p><p>I have heard critiques of the current wave of activism that are fundamentally critiques of faith-there are people deriding this notion that the world will be more just and that we will end white supremacy. It is those people who look back on the legacy of resistance that we have inherited and challenge its outcomes. The police are still killing people, the argument goes, and the racial wealth gap is as big as it has been since the 1920s. Furthermore, the public education systems have failed black and brown kids throughout the country. Thus the danger in believing in the inevitability of change cannot be overstated. The faith they critique-the belief in unnamed forces that will bring about change-is blind faith, and they are right to be critical. But that is not what animates our striving. Protest is the work of hope. Protest, at its core, is telling the truth in public. It is confrontation and disruption rooted in the acknowledgment of a future that has not yet come, but that is possible. The work at hand is hope-work.</p><p>I do not blame anyone who refuses to hold hope in their hands when justice has slipped through our fingers too many times. Many black and other marginalized people have expressed the unfairness of being asked to carry the "burden" of hope, that it's come to feel compulsory for these groups to do so. To this I say that the absence of hope, not its presence, is a burden for people of color. If anything, blackness is a testament of hope: a people born in and of resistance, pushing against a tide meant to destroy, resting in a belief that this world is not the only one that can be.</p><p>I think that faith is actually the burden that people have misnamed as the burden of hope. It is not our task to carry the burden of faith, but it is often our choice. My faith wavers often. I and others have fought and lost. I have seen people crushed by the weight of the opposition. I have seen the best of intentions transformed into self-interest or terror. And I have seen optimism blind people and keep them from addressing the realities of the horror they face. But when my faith wavers, my hope carries me through.</p><p>I think that in some ways the hope of black people is the fuel for this nation; that it is the creativity and ingenuity of a people who have had every reason to choose resignation but have not that fuels both the culture and cadence of this American life.</p><p>Freedom is not only the absence of oppression, but is also the presence of justice and joy. We are fighting to bring about a world that we have not seen before. �Make America Great Again� is a familiar evocation of a mythical time of human flourishing in our nation�s history. What is posited as a time of �greatness� was, for many, a time of rampant racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and sexism. We have never seen a world of equity, justice, and joy. We are trying to create something altogether new. And it is impossible to create something new in the absence of hope.</p><p>I would even go so far as to say that many who decry hope the loudest could eventually be the most hopeful among us. They are doing the pre-work of hope, deconstructing our current realities. But they are afraid that they may fail, so they hesitate to build. Or they fear that the work will be so long-term that it will result in disappointment-and they are trying to guard against disappointment-so they challenge. They explore and unpack but are slow to create. And they publicly decry any efforts to bring forth a better world, because of the possibility and weight of disappointment. To them it sounds fluffy and hollow.</p><p>But belief in tomorrow has never been hollow. It wasn't hollow to those who fought before us. We do not stand in the shadows of those who came before us, but in their glow. And that glow exists because they put forth a vision of the future and they fought for it. We did not invent resistance or discover injustice in August 2014. We exist in a legacy of struggle, a legacy rooted in hope.</p><p>We have a hope rooted in a belief that as sure as hands have made the buildings that dominate the skylines of our cities, hands have made the institutions, practices, and customs that perpetuate racism and injustice that permeate those same cities. What is made by human hands requires maintenance. Buildings can be torn down and built over. Parking lots can become parks and vice versa. Institutions can evolve, change, or be dismantled.</p><p>We can win. And if we do, it will be because more of us understood that this is a system of choices, and we have learned how to build power to make new choices. When they say that power concedes nothing without a demand, they are reminding us that the demand has to create something new-a new power dynamic, a new reality. And hope is the fuel of this demand.</p><p>Hope is not magic. Hope is work. Let's get to the work.</p></p><h2>The Skin Chairs (Virago Modern Classics)</h2><p>After her father&#39;s death, Frances, ten, her mother, two brothers, and three sisters have difficulty adjusting to diminished circumstances and a domineering aunt</p><p>Barbara Comyns (1909-92) was born in Bidford-on-Avon in Warwickshire.

Visit her at www.candace-camp.com.Theo Moreland, Lord Raine, rested his hands on the railing and gazed down at the grand ballroom below, a look of discontent upon his handsome face. His green eyes, fringed by smoky lashes so long and thick they would have looked feminine on any face less ruggedly masculine, moved lazily across the floor below, crowded with dancers.<p> </p><p>He wondered, not for the first time this evening, what he was doing here.</p><p> </p><p>He was not the sort for elegant parties. He liked much more to be out-of-doors, preferably in some exotic locale, doing something more intriguing...and possibly dangerous.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, Lady Rutherford's ball was dangerous in its own way--ambitious mothers and their daughters circling like sharks--but it was the kind of danger that he assiduously avoided. He wasn't sure why he had come here this evening. He had simply been bored and restless, as he had been many times lately, so much so that at last he had flipped through his stack of invitations, usually ignored, and settled on Lady Rutherford's party.</p><p> </p><p>Once he got here, he had regretted the impulse. Besieged by flirtatious women of all ages, he had finally retreated upstairs to the card room. That, too, had paled, and he'd wound up here, gazing down moodily at the wide expanse of floor below.</p><p> </p><p>"Lord Raine, what a surprise," a sultry voice behind him said.</p><p> </p><p>Suppressing a groan, Theo turned. "Lady Scarle." The woman before him was one of the beauties of London and had been for years. Her coloring was vivid, with jet black hair and deep blue eyes, and a strawberries-and-cream complexion. If the color in her cheeks was not entirely natural or a stray white hair or two had to be plucked out whenever they appeared, well, only her personal maid knew about it, and she was paid well to keep secrets. Most men, truth be known, found it difficult to lift their eyes above Lady Scarle's magnificent white bosom, which was, as was customary, spilling out lushly over the low neckline of her purple evening gown.</p><p> </p><p>"Now, now," she said, smiling archly and laying a hand on Theo's arm. "I think that we know each other well enough for you to call me Helena."</p><p> </p><p>Theo shifted uncomfortably and gave her a vague smile. He had never been good at dealing with rapacious females, and he found women like Lady Scarle even more unnerving than giggling young debutantes.</p><p> </p><p>When he had left London on his last expedition, Lady Helena Scarle had been married to doddering old Lord Scarle, and while she had flirted with Theo, she had been interested in nothing more than a light affair, which he had avoided with little problem.</p><p> </p><p>But when he'd returned a few months ago, he found that Lord Scarle had died, leaving the lady a widow. And the widow was interested in finding a new husband--as long as it meant moving up the social or economic scale. Unfortunately for Theo, he fit both requirements.</p><p> </p><p>Lady Scarle had been on the hunt for him ever since. "I was very disappointed not to see you at Lady Hunt-ington's musicale last night," Lady Helena went on silkily.</p><p> </p><p>"Mmm. Not my sort of thing," he replied, looking about, hoping to see some means of getting out of the situation without seeming rude. Lady Scarle, he had found out, was impervious to almost anything short of rudeness.</p><p> </p><p>"Nor mine," she replied with a flirtatious glance. "But I had thought...well, when we talked last week, we discussed whether we might run into one another at the musicale."</p><p> </p><p>"We did?" Theo blurted out, surprised. He did remember running into Lady Scarle when he was out riding in the Park one day last week. She had chattered on for some time before he could get away, but he had not really been listening to what she said. "I mean, well, I must have forgotten. I apologize."</p><p> </p><p>Temper flashed in her blue eyes--she was not used to being forgotten by any man--but she hid it quickly, turning her eyes down and looking up at him beguilingly through her lashes. "Now you have wounded me, Raine. You must make amends by coming to my rout on Tuesday."</p><p> </p><p>"I...um...I'm almost certain I have an engagement that day. My, uh...Kyria!" He spotted his sister walking across the room, and he waved to her.</p><p> </p><p>Kyria, taking in the situation in a glance, grinned and walked over to him. "Theo! What a pleasant surprise. And Lady Scarle." Kyria's gaze swept over the other woman's overexposed chest. "My goodness, you must be chilled. Would you like to borrow my wrap?"</p><p> </p><p>Lady Scarle gave her a stiff smile. "Thank you, I am perfectly warm, Lady Kyria. Or should I say Mrs. McIntyre?"</p><p> </p><p>"Either is all right," Kyria responded calmly. Tall, flame-haired and green-eyed, Kyria was easily the most beautiful woman in the house. She had reigned as the leading beauty of London society since her coming out, earning the appellation "The Goddess" for her beauty and cool confidence. Even now, approaching the age of thirty and a wife and mother, there was no one who could match her.</p><p> </p><p>Lady Scarle, several years older than Kyria, had been married by the time Kyria had made her debut, but it had put her nose out of joint to watch Kyria assume all the acclaim she had once held. The two women had never been friendly.</p><p> </p><p>"Theo." Kyria turned to her brother and linked her hand possessively through his arm. "I had been wondering what had happened to you. I believe I promised my next dance to you."</p><p> </p><p>"Yes." Theo brightened. "Yes, you did." He turned to the other woman and bowed. "Lady Scarle, if you will excuse us..."</p><p> </p><p>Lady Scarle had little choice but to smile and murmur, "Of course."</p><p> </p><p>Quickly Theo swept Kyria away down the stairs. She leaned closer to him and murmured, "Now you owe me."</p><p> </p><p>"I am well aware of that. I didn't know what I was going to do. I was trying to wriggle out of going to some rout of hers next week. I cannot think what possessed me to come here tonight," he added feelingly.</p><p> </p><p>Kyria laughed. "It isn't like you. I was very surprised to see you."</p><p> </p><p>Theo shrugged. "I was bored, I think. I'm not sure what's the matter with me lately. I've felt...restless, I suppose."</p><p> </p><p>"Ready to go off on one of your adventures?" Kyria guessed.</p><p> </p><p>Theo, the eldest son of the Duke of Broughton, had spent most of his adult life exploring the globe. He had always been fascinated with new and exotic locales, and the physical work and even danger that his explorations entailed only added spice to his trips, as far as he was concerned.</p><p> </p><p>He had returned only a few months ago from his last trip, which had been to India and Burma. Usually he rested and recuperated, spending time with his much-loved family, for a while, before he began to itch to travel again.</p><p> </p><p>"I don't know." He frowned. "Edward Horn is setting up a trip to the Congo. He wants me to go."</p><p> </p><p>"But it doesn't sound as if you want to."</p><p> </p><p>"Not really," Theo replied, puzzlement settling on his features. "I told Horn not to count on me. It's very strange. I've been feeling so restless, yet I don't really have the urge to travel anywhere, either. Perhaps I am getting too old for it."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, yes...the grand old age of thirty-four," Kyria teased. "You are quite decrepit, really."</p><p> </p><p>"You know what I mean. Everyone has always told me that someday I would grow up and tire of travel. Maybe I have." He gave her a crooked smile. "All I know is that every time I think of leaving, something holds me back."</p><p> </p><p>Kyria studied her brother's face, her puzzlement turning to concern. "Theo...are you all right? You sound almost...unhappy."</p><p> </p><p>It was not an adjective she was accustomed to using to describe her brother, who had always entered into everything he did with great zest.</p><p> </p><p>Theo looked at her, his expression serious. "You know me, Kyria. I'm not the sort to examine my life. I don't sit about thinking about what I'm doing, or whether or not I'm enjoying myself. I don't brood."</p><p> </p><p>"No. You are more one to charge into things. You generally know what you want and go after it."</p><p> </p><p>He nodded. "Which is why I think I'm so at loose ends. I feel as if there is something missing. But I don't know what it is. Something I should be doing? Some place I should go? I only know I want something else, something more."</p><p> </p><p>Kyria thought for a moment, then began hesitantly. "Well, perhaps, have you thought that you are at an age where you want to settle down? Mayhap what you are missing is a wife--a home and family."</p><p> </p><p>Theo let out a low groan. "That is certainly what they would all like to convince me of," he said, jerking his head toward the mothers and chaperones massed along the wall, watching their charges dance. "I think I have been introduced to every mother of an eligible girl tonight. I can't tell you how many have hinted that it's time for me to settle down. It's enough to make me run for cover. Are they always this voracious?"</p><p> </p><p>Kyria chuckled, nodding. "Yes. There is nothing more dangerous than a mother out to make a good match for her daughter."</p><p> </p><p>"Aren't these the very same women who have long complained that I am lacking in a proper sense of duty and consequence--always off gallivanting about the globe instead of staying here and preparing to take over the title? The ones who call us the 'mad Morelands'?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes. But surely you must know that it does not matter how mad one is if one is going to be a duke someday. A title makes up for a great number of sins, and the higher the title, the more sins it obviates. And if you possess a great deal of wealth in addition, well, you could have two heads, and it wouldn't matter."</p><p> </p><p>"What a cynic you are."</p><p> </p><p>"Only truthful."</p><p> </p><p>"It isn't that I am against marriage," Theo mused. "It is simply...well, I cannot envision tying myself to any of these girls, even one as lovely as Estelle Hopewell."</p><p> </p><p>"Estelle Hopewell! Good heavens, I should hope not. The girl hasn't a thought in her head."</p><p> </p><p>"Do any of them? Perhaps it is just being under the watchful eye of their mamas, but every girl I spoke to tonight could do nothing but smile and agree with whatever I said. None of them seemed to have the slightest...</p></p><h2>When Summer&#39;s in the Meadow</h2><p>Details the experiences of two novice farmers on a farm in western Ireland, relating their experiences at animal husbandry, their attempts to have a child, and their assimilation into Irish life</p><p>In 1985, this Irish-American couple moved from the hectic world of New York book publishing to a small farm in Ireland, attempting to recapture the simpler life of their ancestors. In O Come Ye Back to Ireland, they chronicled their first year. Here they continue the account of their lives as novice farmers in County Clare, describing their successes and failures, the crops and animals they learn to nurture, and the caring neighbors who are always ready to help and instruct. Most poignantly, they tell of their bitter disappointment at learning that they cannot have a child of their own, and of the difficult decision to begin the adoption process. At the heart of the book is the story of a year of waitingwaiting to be approved by the Irish Adoption Board, waiting for a baby, waiting for the baby to be legally theirs. When Deirdre is finally their own and the farm begins to thrive, their contentment is complete. This is the unassuming tale of two people who return to the land and succeed. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.The authors made their debut with O Come Ye Back to Ireland ( LJ 10/15/87), a quaint account of their first year in Ireland after moving from the Big Apple. This sequel is equally successful. It focuses on the couple's attempt to adopt a child. Though they recount various incidents--the shock of a return trip to New York, the scare of a major storm hitting western Ireland--the pending adoption overrides all other concerns. Still, they go on with their pastoral lives: farming, tending livestock, the sharing of a community spirit not found in New York City. Breen and Williams have used a unique format in both books. The text is primarily the product of Williams, while the narrative is interspersed with entries from Breen's diary. Another charming account; recommended for most libraries.<br><i>- Boyd Childress, Auburn Univ .

It was an ingenious deceit, one that out-ponzied Charles Ponzi himself, who only a few years earlier had been arrested for a pyramid scheme. Leo had a good run--his was perhaps the longest fraud in history--and when his enterprise finally collapsed in 1923, he vanished. The Cook County state&#x2019;s attorney, a man whose lust for power equaled Leo&#x2019;s own lust for money, began an international manhunt that lasted almost a year. When finally apprehended, Leo was living a life of luxury in Nova Scotia under the assumed identity of a book dealer and literary critic. A salacious court hearing followed, and his mysterious death in a Chicago prison rivaled the rest of his almost-too-bizarre-to-believe life.<br><br> A rip-roaring tale of greed, financial corruption, dirty politics, over-the-top and under-the-radar deceit, illicit sex, and a brilliant and wildly charming con man on the town and then on the lam, <i>Empire of Deception</i> has it all.

Set mostly in Chicago during the Roaring Twenties, the same era that brought us Ponzi and his famous scheme, Jobb&#x2019;s book is divided into three acts. Act One introduces readers to Koretz, who managed to bilk millions from mostly rich &#x201c;investors&#x201d; who thought they were getting entr�e into oil and timber interests in Panama. Act Two shows his years of hard criminal work paying off (he lived in a mansion and owned two Rolls Royces) and also catching up to him. Act Three shows him fleeing to Nova Scotia, where he dated a slew of women and threw lavish parties until he was eventually caught. What makes this book so interesting is the excellent pacing and fine detail laced throughout (although toward the end of the book that detail threatens, momentarily, to stall the momentum that Jobb so skillfully builds), the joy of reading about a man who could have taught Bernie Madoff a thing or two, and the sheer chutzpah (and, yes, skill) of Leo Koretz, who for a time lived like Gatsby and who managed to separate millions of dollars from people who probably should have known better. <em>--Chris Schluep</em> </p><b>&#x201c;A rollicking tale that is one part <i>The Sting</i>, one part <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, and one part <i>The Devil in the White City</i>.&#x201d; &#x2014;Karen Abbott, author of <i>Liar, Temptress, Soldier, Spy</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> It was a time of unregulated madness.

Despite carrying a U.S. passport, Vinnie feels essentially English and rather looks down on her fellow Americans. But in spite of that, she is drawn into a mortifying and oddly satisfying affair with an Oklahoman tourist who dresses more Bronco Billy than Beau Brummel.<br><br>Also in London is Vinnie&#x2019;s colleague Fred Turner, a handsome, flat broke, newly separated, and thoroughly miserable young man trying to focus on his own research. Instead, he is distracted by a beautiful and unpredictable English actress and the world she belongs to. <br><br>Both American, both abroad, and both achingly lonely, Vinnie and Fred play out their confused alienation and dizzying romantic liaisons in Alison Lurie&#x2019;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.

She teaches writing, folklore, and literature at Cornell University.1<br><br> As I walked by myself<br><br> And talked to myself,<br><br> Myself said unto me,<br><br> Look to thyself,<br><br> Take care of thyself,<br><br> For nobody cares for thee.<br><br> Old Song<br><br> On a cold blowy February day a woman is boarding the ten a.m. flight to London, followed by an invisible dog. The woman&#x2019;s name is Virginia Miner: she is fifty-four years old, small, plain, and unmarried&#x2014;the sort of person that no one ever notices, though she is an Ivy League college professor who has published several books and has a well-established reputation in the expanding field of children&#x2019;s literature.<br><br> The dog that is trailing Vinnie, visible only to her imagination, is her familiar demon or demon familiar, known to her privately as Fido and representing self-pity. She visualizes him as a medium-sized dirty-white long-haired mutt, mainly Welsh terrier: sometimes trailing her silently, at other times whining and panting and nipping at her heels; when bolder, dashing round in circles trying to trip her up, or at least get her to stoop down so that he may rush at her, knock her to the ground, and cover her with sloppy kisses. Vinnie knows very well that Fido wants to get onto the plane with her, but she hopes to leave him behind, as she has successfully done on other trips abroad. Recent events, however, and the projected length of her stay, make this unlikely.<br><br> Vinnie is leaving today for six months in England on a foundation grant. There, under her professional name of V. A. Miner, she will continue her study of the folk-rhymes of schoolchildren. She has made this journey a number of times, and through a process of trial and error reduced its expense and discomfort to a minimum. She always chooses a daytime charter flight, preferring those on which no films are shown. If she could afford it, she would pay the regular fare so as to avoid boarding delays (she has already stood in various lines for nearly an hour); but that would be foolishly extravagant. Her grant is small, and she will have to watch expenses carefully as it is.<br><br> Though patience is held to be a virtue most appropriate to women, especially aging women, Vinnie has always particularly disliked waiting for anything, and never does so if it can be avoided. Now, for instance, she elbows her way deftly past less experienced passengers who are searching for their seat numbers or are encumbered with excess luggage or with children, excusing herself in a thin pleasant voice. By crossing through the galley to the far aisle and back again between two rows of seats, she outflanks a massed confusion of obvious rubes with carry-on bags labeled sun tours. In less time than it takes to read this paragraph she has made her way to a window seat near an exit in the nonsmoking section, pausing only to extract the London Times and British Vogue from a magazine rack. (Once the plane is airborne, the stewardess will distribute periodicals to all the passengers, but those Vinnie prefers may vanish before they reach her.)<br><br> Following her usual procedure, Vinnie slides into her place and unzips her boots. In stocking feet she climbs onto the seat and opens the overhead locker; since she is barely over five feet tall, this is the only way she can reach it. She removes two pillows and a loose-woven blue blanket, which she drops onto the center seat beside her handbag and her British periodicals, thus tacitly claiming this space if&#x2014;as is likely in midweek and mid-February&#x2014;it hasn&#x2019;t been assigned to anyone. Then she arranges her worn wool-lined raincoat, her floppy beige felt hat, and her amber-and-beige Liberty-print wool shawl in the locker, in such a way that only the rudest of fellow passengers will attempt to encroach upon them. She slams the locker shut with some difficulty, and sits down. She stows her boots under her own seat along with a carton of duty-free Bristol Cream sherry, and puts on a pair of folding slippers. She arranges one pillow beside her head and wedges the other between her hip and the arm of the chair. Finally she smooths her crisply cut graying hair, leans back, and with a sigh fastens the seatbelt across her tan wool sweater and skirt.<br><br> A disinterested observer, Vinnie is quite aware, might well consider these maneuvers and condemn her as self-concerned and grasping. In this culture, where energy and egotism are rewarded in the young and good-looking, plain aging women are supposed to be self-effacing, uncomplaining&#x2014;to take up as little space and breathe as little air as possible. All very well, she thinks, if you travel with someone dear to you or at least familiar: someone who will help you stow away your coat, tuck a pillow behind your head, find you a newspaper&#x2014;or if you choose, converse with you.<br><br> But what of those who travel alone? Why should Vinnie Miner, whose comfort has been disregarded by others for most of her adult life, disregard her own comfort? Why should she allow her coat, hat, and belongings to be crushed by the coats and hats and belongings of younger, larger, handsomer persons? Why should she sit alone for seven or eight hours, pillowless and chilled, reading an outdated copy of Punch, with her feet swollen and her pale amber eyes watering from the smoke of the cigarette fiends in the adjoining seats? As she often says to herself&#x2014;though never aloud, for she knows how unpleasant it would sound&#x2014;why shouldn&#x2019;t she look out for herself? Nobody else will.<br><br> But such internal arguments, frequent as they are with Vinnie, occupy little of her mind now. The uneven, uncharacteristically loud sigh she gave as she sank back against the scratchy blue plush was not a sigh of contentment, or even one of relief: it was an exhalation of wretchedness. Her travel routine has been performed by rote; if she were alone, she would break into wails of misery and vexation, and stain the London Times with her tears.<br><br> Twenty minutes ago, while waiting in the departure lounge in a cheerful mood, Vinnie read in a magazine of national circulation a scornful and disparaging reference to her life&#x2019;s work. Projects such as hers, the article stated, are a prime example of the waste of public funds, the proliferation of petty and useless scholarship, and the general weakness and folly of the humanities in America today. Do we really need a scholarly study of playground doggerel? inquired the writer, one L. D. Zimmern, a professor of English at Columbia. No doubt Mr. or Ms. Miner would answer this query by assuring us of the social, historical, or literary value of &#x201c;Ring-around-a-rosy,&#x201d; he continued, sawing through the supports of any possible answer; but he, for one, was not convinced.<br><br> What makes this unprovoked attack especially hideous is that for over thirty years the Atlantic has been Vinnie&#x2019;s favorite magazine. Though she was raised in the suburbs of New York and teaches at an upstate university, her imaginative loyalties are to New England. She has often thought that American culture took a long downward step when its hegemony passed from Boston to New York in the late nineteenth century; and it has been a comfort to her that the Atlantic continues to be edited from Back Bay. When she pictures her work receiving general public recognition, it is to this magazine that she awards the honor of discovery. She has fantasized the process often: the initial letter of inquiry, the respectfully eager manner of the interviewer, the title of the finished essay; the moment when her colleagues at Corinth University and elsewhere will open the magazine and see her name printed on its glossy pages in its characteristic and elegant typeface. (Vinnie&#x2019;s ambition, though steady and ardent, is comparatively modest: it hasn&#x2019;t occurred to her that her name might be printed upon the cover of the Atlantic.) She has imagined all that will follow: the sudden delighted smiles of her friends; the graceless grins of those who are not her friends and have undervalued both her and her subject. The latter group, alas, will be much more numerous.<br><br> For the truth is that children&#x2019;s literature is a poor relation in her department&#x2014;indeed, in most English departments: a stepdaughter grudgingly tolerated because, as in the old tales, her words are glittering jewels of a sort that attract large if not equally brilliant masses of undergraduates. Within the departmental family she sits in the chimney-corner, while her idle, ugly siblings dine at the chairman&#x2019;s table&#x2014;though, to judge by enrollment figures, many of them must spout toads and lizards.<br><br> Well, Vinnie thinks bitterly, now she has got her wish; her work has been mentioned in the Atlantic. Just her luck&#x2014;because surely there were others whose project titles might have attracted the spiteful attention of L. D. Zimmern. But of course it was she he chose, what else could she expect? Vinnie realizes that Fido has followed her onto the plane and is snuffling at her legs, but she lacks the energy to push him away.<br><br> Above her seat the warning light has been turned on; the engines begin to vibrate as if with her own internal tremor. Vinnie stares through the streaked, distorting oblong of glass at gray tarmac, pitted heaps of dirty congealed snow, other planes taxiing toward takeoff; but what she sees is a crowd of Atlantic magazines queuing for departure or already en route, singly or in squadrons, flying over the United States in the hands and briefcases of travelers, hitching their way in automobiles, loaded onto trucks and trains, bundled and tied for sale on newsstands. She visualizes what must come or has already come of this mass migration: she sees, all over the country&#x2014;in homes and offices, in libraries and dentists&#x2019; waiting rooms&#x2014;her colleagues, ex-colleagues, students, ex-students, neighbors, ex-neighbors, friends, and ex-friends (not to mention the me...</p><h2>Traditional English Gardens</h2><p>Text and photographs portray the designs, plants, and flowers of 28 gardens in England</p><p>Arabella Lennox-Boyd is a distinguished garden designer with an extensive practice throughout Europe.

From the billowing herbaceous borders of Blickling Hall and Upton Park to the toparied formality of Hidcote and Knightshayes, all are meticulously maintained. Open to the public they have to be in prime condition and whilst neat grass and formal beds display this to perfection, herbaceous borders are allowed a short leash to display their lushness and fullness to best advantage.

The manner of his death was sudden, violent and unpremeditated, and there are some who argue that he kiled himself because he was tormented by guilt - guilt that he had survived the horrors of Auschwitz while others, better than he, had gone to the wall.</p><p>'<i>The Drowned and the Saved</i> dispels the myth that Primo Levi forgave the Germans for what they did to his people. He didn't, and couldn't forgive. He refused, however, to indulge in what he called "the bestial vice of hatred" which is an entirely different matter. The voice that sounds in his writing is that of a reasonable man . . . it warns and reminds us that the unimaginable can happen again.

The facility they commandeered was more than a secret station on the ocean floor. Atlantis was an exit strategy for the corporate elite, a place where the world's Movers and Shakers had hidden from the doomsday microbe �ehemoth-and from the hordes of the moved and the shaken left behind. For five years "rifters" and "corpses" have lived in a state of uneasy truce, united by fear of the outside world.<br><br>But now that world closes in. An unknown enemy hunts them through the crushing darkness of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. �ehemoth- twisted, mutated, more virulent than ever-has found them already. The fragile armistice between the rifters and their one-time masters has exploded into all-out war, and not even the legendary Lenie Clarke can take back the body count.<br><br>Billions have died since she loosed �ehemoth upon the world. Billions more are bound to. The whole biosphere came apart at the seams while Lenie Clarke hid at the bottom of the sea and did nothing. But now there is no place left to hide. The consequences of past acts reach inexorably to the very floor of the world, and Lenie Clarke must return to confront the mess she made.<br><br>Redemption doesn't come easy with the blood of a world on your hands.

He is currently writing an unrelated literary novel involving space vampires for Tor. He lives in Toronto, Canada.<br>Starred Review. In Canadian author Watts's intense, beautifully written conclusion to his Rifters trilogy (after 2004's <i>�ehemoth: �-Max</i>), Lenie Clarke, the near-psychotic, bio-engineered woman who loosed the deadly organism known as �ehemoth on an already environmentally compromised world, resurfaces from the ocean's depths to discover who's behind continuing efforts to destroy all life on Earth. Together with Lubin, a bio-engineered man who's a highly efficient killer, Clarke discovers an America that has been devastated, not just by �ehemoth but by attacks from heavily fortified, high-tech enclaves whose rulers will stop at nothing in a futile attempt to contain the out-of-control organism. Worse still, the battle is apparently being led by Achilles Desjardins, a murderous psychopath who has slipped the protective psychological programming that once kept his darker impulses under control. Aided by Taka Ouellette, a guilt-ridden, second-rate physician, Clarke and Lubin strive desperately to unravel the secrets of both �ehemoth and Seppuku, its even more dangerous mutation. Like some adrenaline-charged fusion of Clarke's <i>The Deep Range</i> and Gibson's <i>Neuromancer</i>, Watts's trilogy represents a major addition to early 21st-century hard SF. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

(Hail to victory): An illustrated history of Germany from Bismarck to Hitler</h2><p>ABOUT THIS BOOK -- A compelling photographic history of Germany from 1862 to 1945. This book provides comprehensive coverage of German identity and German power from Bismarck&#39;s unification of Germany through the fall of the 3rd Reich. Editorially sound and historically savvy, over 50% of the book is devoted to the Weimar Republic through the end of World War II. ABOUT THE COVER IMAGE -- A confounding painted &#34;portrait&#34; derived from a famous photomontage, the cover gives us Hitler&#39;s face, Kaiser Wilhem II&#39;s moustache, and Bismarck&#39;s uniform. ABOUT THE AUTHOR -- Stefan Lorant is probably best remembered for his memoir &#34;I Was Hitler&#39;s Prisoner.&#34; Lorant, according to Steven Heller, is imporant because &#34;Even if the Hungarian born Stefan Lorant (1901-1997) did not, as he claims, invent the modern photo-journalistic essay, he was certainly in the vanguard, indeed helped perfect the form.... A self-taught photographer, writer and film-maker, he developed unique methods of picture / text narration that defined subsequent &#39;golden age&#39; photo magazines....&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Ash and Quill (The Great Library)</h2><p><b>The unforgettable characters from <i>Ink and Bone</i> and <i>Paper and Fire</i> unite to save the Great Library of Alexandria from itself in this electrifying adventure in the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Hoarding all the knowledge of the world, the Great Library jealously guards its secrets.

Flames left fragile curls of ash. Leather bindings smoked and shriveled and blackened, just like burning flesh.<br><br> Jess Brightwell watched the fire climb the pyramid of books and willed himself not to flinch as each layer caught. His brain raced with involuntary calculations. One hundred books in five layers. The burning bottom layer: forty-four gone. The second level held another thirty-two, and it was already billowing dull smoke. The next had eighteen more volumes, then five on top of that. The pyramid was capped by one lone book that sat tantalizingly ready for the grabbing. Easy to save as the flames climbed the stack, consuming layer after layer and burning something inside him blacker and colder.<br><br> If I could just save one . . .<br><br> But he couldn't save anything. Even himself, at the moment.<br><br> Jess's head hurt fiercely in the glare of the sun. Everything was still a blur. He remembered the chaos of London as the Welsh army descended on it, a battle even he had never imagined the English would lose; he remembered the mesmerizing sight of the dome of St. Paul's catching fire above them as librarians struggled to save what they could.<br><br> He remembered his father and brother, when it counted, turning their backs on him and running.<br><br> Most of all, he remembered being forced into the Translation Chamber, and the sickening ripping sensation of being destroyed and created again far, far from London . . . here in the Burner-held city of Philadelphia.<br><br> Sent to the rebellious colonies of America.<br><br> Jess and his friends hadn't been granted any time to recover; they'd been dragged, still sick and weak, to what must have once been a sports stadium; in better times, maybe it had been filled with cheering crowds. Now it was half ruined, melted into a misshapen lump on one side of the concrete stands, and instead of a grassy field in the middle there were bare ground and a funeral pyre of books.<br><br> Jess couldn't take his eyes off of them as they burned, because he was thinking, sickly, We're next.<br><br> "Jess," said Scholar Christopher Wolfe, who was on his knees next to him in the dirt. "They're not original books. They're Blanks." That was true. But Jess didn't miss the tremors running through the man, either. The shine in Wolfe's dark eyes was made of pure, unholy rage. He was right: Blanks were just empty paper and bindings provided by the Great Library of Alexandria, vessels to hold words copied on command from originals kept safe within the Library's archives. These were empty symbols that were burning. In any Library territory, they'd be cheaply and easily replaced, and nothing would be lost at all.<br><br> But seeing them destroyed still hurt. He'd been raised to love books, for all that his family had smuggled them, sold them, and profited from them.<br><br> Words were sacred things, and this was a particularly awful kind of heresy.<br><br> As he watched, the last book shivered in the rising heat, as if it might break free and escape the fire. But then the edges crisped, paper smoked, and it was gone in rising curls of ash.<br><br> Scholar Khalila Seif knelt on his left side, as straight and quiet as a statue. She looked perfectly calm; she had her hands resting lightly on her thighs, her head high and her hijab fluttering lightly at the edges in the hot breeze. Beneath the black silk Scholar's outer robe she wore a still-clean dress, only a little muddy and ashen at the hem from their progress through London. Next to Khalila, Glain Wathen looked as if she were only momentarily frozen in the act of rising-a lithe warrior, all vibrating tension. Beyond her was Thomas Schreiber, then Morgan Hault, then-last and least, in Jess's thoughts-Dario Santiago. Outcast, even among their little band of exiles.<br><br> To Jess's right was Scholar Wolfe and, beyond him, Captain Santi. That was the entire roll call of their party of prisoners, and not a single useful weapon among them. They'd not had time to make a plan. Jess couldn't imagine that any of them had much worthwhile to say just now.<br><br> There was an audience in the crumbling stands: the good citizens of Philadelphia. A ragged, patchwork crowd of hard men and women and children who'd survived starvation, deprivation of all sorts, and constant attacks. They had no pity for the pampered servants of the Great Library.<br><br> What would Wolfe tell them if he had the chance? That the Great Library was still a great and precious thing, something to be saved, not destroyed? That the cancer that had rotted it from within could still be healed? They'd never believe it. Jess took in a deep breath and choked on the stench of burning books. Imaginary Wolfe, he thought, gave crap speeches.<br><br> A man dressed in a fine-cut suit of black wool stepped up to block Jess's view of the pyre. He was a tall, bespectacled fellow, full of the confidence of a man of property; he could have, by appearance, been a banker or a lawyer in a more normal sort of place. The smoke that rose black against the pale blue morning sky seemed to billow right from the crown of his head. His collar-length hair was the same gray as the ash.<br><br> Willinger Beck. Elected leader of the Burners of Philadelphia-and, by extension, all Burners everywhere, since this place was the symbol of their fanatical movement. The head fanatic in a movement composed entirely of fanatics.<br><br> He studied their faces without making any comment at all. He must have enjoyed what he saw.<br><br> "Very impressive waste of resources," Scholar Wolfe said. His tone was sour, and completely bracing to Jess. Wolfe sounds the same, no matter what. "Is this a prelude to setting us on fire next?"<br><br> "Don't be ridiculous," Beck said. "Surely our learned guests understand the power of a symbol."<br><br> "This is barbaric," Khalila said from Jess's other side. "A criminal waste."<br><br> "My dear Scholar, we handwrite our own books here. On paper we rescue by picking apart the Library's Blanks and destroying their alchemical bindings. You speak of us as barbaric? Do you know whose symbols you wear? You will not take that tone with us." At the end of it, his friendly voice sharpened into an edge.<br><br> Jess said, "Talk to her that way again and I'll snap your kneecaps." His hands were not bound. He was free to move; they all were. Which meant they could, as a group, do serious damage before they were taken down by the Burner guards stationed behind them.<br><br> In theory, anyway. He knew the guard directly behind him held a gun barrel trained on the back of his neck, precisely where it could blow a hole that would instantly end his life.<br><br> But he'd gotten Beck's attention, and his stare. Good.<br><br> "Here now," Beck said, back to mild and reproving. "We should be friends, after all; we share a common sense that the Great Library of Alexandria has become a destructive parasite. It's no longer some great, untouchable icon. There's no need for anger between us."<br><br> "I'm not familiar with American customs," said Captain Santi, on the other side of Wolfe. He sounded pleasant and calm. Jess sincerely doubted he was either. "Is this how you treat your friends?"<br><br> "Considering you alone put three of my men in the infirmary on your arrival, even in your weakened state? Yes," Beck said. "Captain Santi, we really do resist the Library, just as I am told you do. So should we all. The Library grants people pitiful drops of knowledge while it hoards up oceans for itself. Surely you, too, must see the way it manipulates the world to its own gain." He nodded at the black robe that Wolfe wore. "The common man calls you Scholars by another name: Stormcrows. That black robe isn't a sign of your scholarship anymore, and it isn't an object of reverence. It's a sign of the chaos and destruction you bring down in your wake."<br><br> "No," Wolfe said. "It still stands for what it's always stood for: that I will die to preserve the knowledge of this world. I may hate the Archivist, I may want him and his brand of greed and cruelty gone, but I still hold to the ideals. The robe is a symbol of that." He paused, and his tone took on silky, dark contempt. "You, of all people, understand the power of a symbol."<br><br> "Oh, I do," Beck said. "Take the robe off."<br><br> Wolfe's chin went up, just a fraction. He was staring straight at Beck. His graying hair whipped in the hot breeze from the pyre, and still he didn't blink as he said, simply, "No."<br><br> "Last chance, Scholar Wolfe. If you repudiate the Library now, it will all go better for you. The Library certainly doesn't stand by you."<br><br> "No."<br><br> Beck nodded to someone behind them, and Jess, from the corner of his eye, saw the flash of a knife being drawn. He tried to turn, but a hand fell hard on his shoulder, and the gun barrel pressed close enough to bruise the base of his skull.<br><br> He was already too late for any kind of rescue.<br><br> One of Beck's guards grabbed Wolfe's black robe by the sleeve and sliced the silk all the way to the neck-left sleeve, then right, efficient and ruthlessly precise cuts. With the flourish of a cheap street magician, the man tore the robe from Wolfe to leave him kneeling in plain, dark street clothes. He held the mangled fabric up above his head. A breeze heated by burning books caught the silk and fluttered it out like a ragged banner.<br><br> Wolfe's expression never changed, but next to him, Niccolo Santi let out a purely murderous growl and came half up from his knees before the guard behind him slammed a heavy metal club into the back of his head. The blow crashed Santi back down. He looked dazed but still dangerous.<br><br> The man who'd taken Wolfe's robe paraded it around, as proud as a strutting rooster, and from the stands applause and cheers swelled. It nearly covered up the muttering roar of burning books. Beck ignored that and pointed to Khalila. "Now her." Another guard stepped up to the young woman, but before he could use his knife, Khalila held up both hands. The gesture looked like an order, not a surrender, and it stopped the guard in his tracks.<br><br> "I will stand up now," Khalila said. "I will not resist."<br><br> The guard looked uncertainly at Beck, who raised his eyebrows and nodded.<br><br> Jess watched her tensely from the corner of his eye as she stood in a smooth, calm motion, and from her other side, he saw Glain doing the same, openly ready to fight if Khalila gave a sign she needed help.<br><br> But Khalila lifted her hands in a graceful, unhurried way to unfasten the catch that held the black silk robe closed at her throat. She slipped the robe off her shoulders and caught it as it fluttered down, then folded it with precise movements into a neat, smooth square.<br><br> Then she took a step forward and held the folded silk out, one hand supporting it, the other on top, like a queen presenting a gift to a subject. In one calculated move, she had taken Willinger Beck's symbol away and made it her own. Jess felt a fierce surge of savage joy at the look on Beck's face. He'd just been bested by a girl a quarter of his age, and the taste seemed bitter.<br><br> But he wasn't taking that without hitting back, and Jess saw that an instant before Beck grabbed the folded robe and flung it into the pyre of burning books. Petty contempt, but it struck Jess like a gut punch. He saw a shiver run through Khalila, too . . . just the barest flinch. Like Wolfe, she lifted her chin. Defiant.<br><br> "Only cowards are so afraid of a scrap of cloth," she said, clear enough to carry to the stands. There was a shimmer in her eyes: anger, not tears. "We may not agree with the Archivist; we may want to see him gone and better Scholars take his place. But we still stand for knowledge. You stand for nothing."<br><br> Beck looked past her and gave a bare, terse nod to a guard, and in the next instant, Khalila was seized, yanked back, and forced to her knees. She almost fell, toppling toward Jess. He instinctively put out a hand to help her, and her fingers twined with his.<br><br> That was the instant he understood what she was really about. Removing her robe hadn't been just defiance; it was distraction. Concealed between her fingers, she held a single metal hairpin-one she'd plucked from under her hijab.<br><br> She knew that in Jess's hands, a hairpin was as good a weapon as any.<br><br> A vast, cooling sense of relief washed through his chest, and he exchanged a swift glance with her as he slipped the pin between his own fingers. She's right. Sooner or later, there'll be locks to open. If we live so long.</p><h2>My Lobotomy</h2><p>At twelve, Howard Dully was guilty of the same crimes as other boys his age: he was moody and messy, rambunctious with his brothers, contrary just to prove a point, and perpetually at odds with his parents. Yet somehow, this normal boy became one of the youngest people on whom Dr. Walter Freeman performed his barbaric transorbital&#x2014;or ice pick&#x2014;lobotomy.<br><br>Abandoned by his family within a year of the surgery, Howard spent his teen years in mental institutions, his twenties in jail, and his thirties in a bottle. It wasn&#x2019;t until he was in his forties that Howard began to pull his life together. But even as he began to live the &#x201c;normal&#x201d; life he had been denied, Howard struggled with one question: Why?<br><br>&#x201c;October 8, 1960. I gather that Mrs. Dully is perpetually talking, admonishing, correcting, and getting worked up into a spasm, whereas her husband is impatient, explosive, rather brutal, won&#x2019;t let the boy speak for himself, and calls him numbskull, dimwit, and other uncomplimentary names.&#x201d;<br><br>There were only three people who would know the truth: Freeman, the man who performed the procedure; Lou, his cold and demanding stepmother who brought Howard to the doctor&#x2019;s attention; and his father, Rodney. Of the three, only Rodney, the man who hadn&#x2019;t intervened on his son&#x2019;s behalf, was still living. Time was running out. Stable and happy for the first time in decades, Howard began to search for answers. <br><br>&#x201c;December 3, 1960. Mr. and Mrs. Dully have apparently decided to have Howard operated on. I suggested [they] not tell Howard anything about it.&#x201d;<br><br>Through his research, Howard met other lobotomy patients and their families, talked with one of Freeman&#x2019;s sons about his father&#x2019;s controversial life&#x2019;s work, and confronted Rodney about his complicity. And, in the archive where the doctor&#x2019;s files are stored, he finally came face to face with the truth.<br><br>Revealing what happened to a child no one&#x2014;not his father, not the medical community, not the state&#x2014;was willing to protect,<i> My Lobotomy</i> exposes a shameful chapter in the history of the treatment of mental illness. Yet, ultimately, this is a powerful and moving chronicle of the life of one man. Without reticence, Howard Dully shares the story of a painfully dysfunctional childhood, a misspent youth, his struggle to claim the life that was taken from him, and his redemption.</p><p>HOWARD DULLY is a tour bus driver who lives happily with his wife in San Jose, California. This is his first book.<br><br>CHARLES FLEMING is a former Newsweek correspondent and Vanity Fair contributor and the coauthor of a number of bestselling nonfiction books. He lives in Los Angeles.Chapter 1<br><br>June<br><br>This much I know for sure: I was born in Peralta Hospital in Oakland, California, on November 30, 1948. My parents were Rodney Lloyd Dully and June Louise Pierce Dully. I was their first child, and they named me Howard August Dully, after my father&#x2019;s father. Rodney was twenty-three. June was thirty-four.<br><br>They had been married less than a year. Their wedding was held on Sunday, December 28, 1947, three days after Christmas, at one o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon, at the Westminster Presbyterian Church in Sacramento, California. The wedding photographs show an eager, nervous couple. He&#x2019;s in white tie and tails, with a white carnation in his lapel. She&#x2019;s in white satin, and a veil decorated with white flowers. They are both dark-haired and dark-eyed. Together they are cutting the cake&#x2014;staring at the cake, not at each other&#x2014;and smiling.<br><br>A reception followed at 917 Forty-fifth Street, at the home of my mother&#x2019;s uncle Ross and aunt Ruth Pierce. My father&#x2019;s mother attended. So did his two brothers. One of them, his younger brother, Kenneth, wore a tuxedo all the way up from San Jose on the train.<br><br>My father&#x2019;s relatives were railroad workers and lumberjack types from the area around Chehalis and Centralia, Washington. My dad spent his summers in a lumber camp with one of his uncles. They were logging people.<br><br>My father&#x2019;s father was an immigrant, born in 1899 in a place called Revel, Estonia, in what would later be the Soviet Union. When he left Estonia, his name was August Tulle. When he got to America, where he joined his brothers, Alexander and John&#x2014; he had two sisters, Marja and Lovisa, whom he left behind in Estonia&#x2014;he was called August Dully. He later added the first name Howard, because it sounded American to him.<br><br>My father&#x2019;s mother was the child of immigrants from Ireland. She was born Beulah Belle Cowan in Litchfield, Michigan, in 1902. Her family later moved to Portland, Oregon, in time for Beulah to attend high school, where she was so smart she skipped two grades.<br><br>August went to Portland, too, because that&#x2019;s where his brothers were. According to his World War I draft registration card, he was brown-haired, blue-eyed, and of medium height. He got work as a window dresser for the Columbia River Ship Company. He became a mason. He met the redheaded Beulah at a dance. She told her mother that night, &#x201c;I just met the man I&#x2019;m going to marry.&#x201d; She was sixteen. A short while later, they tied the knot and took a freighter to San Francisco for their honeymoon, and stayed. A 1920 U.S. Census survey shows them living in an apartment building on Fourth Street. Howard A. Dully was now a naturalized citizen, working as a laborer in the shipyards.<br><br>Sometime after, they moved to Washington, where my grandfather went to work on the railroads. They started having sons&#x2014;Eugene, Rodney, and Kenneth&#x2014;before August got sick with tuberculosis. Beulah believed he caught it on that freighter going to San Francisco. He died at home, in bed, on New Year&#x2019;s Day, 1929. My dad was three years old. His baby brother was only fourteen months old.<br><br>Beulah Belle never remarried. She was hardheaded and strong-willed. She said, &#x201c;I will never again have a man tell me what to do.&#x201d;<br><br>But she had a hard time taking care of her family. She couldn&#x2019;t keep up payments on the house. When she lost it, the boys went to stay with relatives. My dad was sent to live with an aunt and uncle at age six, and was shuffled from place to place after that. By his own account, he lived in six different cities before he finished high school&#x2014;born in Centralia, Washington; then shipped around Oregon to Marshfield, Grants Pass, Medford, and Eugene; then to Ryderwood, Washington, where he and his brother Kenneth lived in a logging camp with their former housekeeper Evelyn Townsend and her husband, Orville Black.<br><br>At eighteen, Rod left Washington to serve with the U.S. Army, enlisting in San Francisco on December 9, 1943. Though he later was reluctant to talk about it, I know from my uncles that he was sent overseas and stationed in France. He served with the 723rd Railroad Division, laying track in an area near L&#x2019;Aigle, France, that was surrounded by mines. One of my uncles told me that my father never recovered from the war. He said, &#x201c;The man who went away to France never came back. He was damaged by what he saw there.&#x201d;<br><br>But another of my uncles told me Rod bragged about having a German girlfriend, so I guess it wasn&#x2019;t all bad. Not as bad as his brother Gene, who joined the army and got sent to Australia and New Guinea, where he developed malaria and tuberculosis and almost died. He weighed one hundred pounds when he came back to America, and lived at a military hospital in Livermore, California, for a long time after that.<br><br>By the time Rod finished his military service, his mother had left her job with Western Union Telegraph, in the Northwest, and moved to Oakland to work for the Southern Pacific Railroad. She was later made a night supervisor, working in the San Francisco office on Market Street. She would still be working there when I was born.<br><br>My mother&#x2019;s folks came from the other end of the economic spectrum. June was the daughter of Daisy Seulberger and Hubert O. Pierce&#x2014;German on her mother&#x2019;s side, English on her father&#x2019;s. Daisy grew up weatlthy, married Pierce, and had three children: Gordon, June, and Hugh. When Pierce died, Daisy married Delos Patrician, another wealthy Bay Area businessman. She moved her family to Oakland, into a huge, three-story shingled home on Newton Avenue. June spent her childhood there.<br><br>After his military service, my father relocated to the Bay Area and started taking classes at San Francisco Junior College, learning to be a teacher and doing his undergraduate work in elementary education.<br><br>Over the summers, he got part-time work at a popular high Sierras vacation spot, Tuolumne Meadows, in Yosemite. He met a young woman there, working as a housekeeper, who captured his eye. Her name was June.<br><br>She was tall, dark, and athletic, and for Rod she was a real catch. She was a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley, where she had been active with the Alpha Xi Delta sorority, and had a certificate to teach nursery school. She was from a well-known Oakland family, and for several years she had been a fixture on the local social scene. During the war she had worked in Washington, D.C., as a private secretary to the U.S. congressman from her district. When she returned to Oakland, she often had her name in the newspapers, hosting luncheons and teas for her society friends.<br><br>She had been courted by quite a few young men, but her controlling mother, Daisy, drove all the boyfriends away. When she met Rod, June was still beautiful, but she was no longer what you&#x2019;d call young, especially not at that time. She was thirty-two. Being unmarried at that age during the 1940s was almost like being a spinster.<br><br>Their courtship was sudden and passionate. They fell in love over the summer of 1946, and saw each other in San Francisco and Berkeley through the next year. When June returned to work in Yosemite in the summer of &#x2019;47, this time at Glen Aulin Camp, Rod left for the lumberyards of northern California and southern Oregon, where he was determined to make enough money to marry June in style. His letters over that summer were eager and filled with love. He was full of plans and promises&#x2014;for his career, their wedding, the house he would buy her, the family they would have. He was worried that he was not the man June&#x2019;s mother wanted, or from the right level of society, but he was determined to prove himself. &#x201c;I expect to make you happy. I won&#x2019;t marry you and take you into a life you won&#x2019;t be happy in,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m happy now, much happier than I&#x2019;ve ever been before in my life, cause you&#x2019;re my little dream girl and my dream is coming true.&#x201d;<br><br>After a hard summer of logging work, the plans for the wedding were made. The ceremony was held three days after Christmas in Sacramento. According to a newspaper story a week later, the couple was &#x201c;honeymooning in Carmel&#x201d; after a ceremony in which &#x201c;the bride wore a white satin gown with a sweetheart neckline, long sleeves ending in points at the wrists and full skirt with a double peplum pointed at the front. Her full-length veil of silk net was attached to a bandeau of seed pearls and orange blossoms. She also carried a handkerchief which has been in her family for 75 years.&#x201d;<br><br>The bride was given away by her uncle Ross, in whose Sacramento house she had been living. The groom&#x2019;s best man was his brother Kenneth.<br><br>According to family stories, some of June&#x2019;s family objected. Rod was too young for June, Daisy said, and didn&#x2019;t have good prospects. June may have been uncomfortable with the relative poverty she was marrying into, too. My dad later told people that he got into a fender bender not long after he met June, and that his feelings were hurt when she said she was embarrassed to be seen driving around in his banged-up car.<br><br>With a wife to support, my father left school. He and my mother moved up north, to Medford, Oregon, where Rod returned to the lumber business and went to work as a lumber tallyman with the Southern Oregon Sugar Pine Corporation in Central Point, two miles outside of Medford.<br><br>Soon the young married couple had a baby on the way&#x2014;me. Near the end of her term, my mother left my dad in Medford and moved in with her mother in Oakland, a pattern she would repeat for the births of all her children.<br><br>If everything had gone as planned, she probably would have returned to Medford and raised a family.<br><br>But my father had some bad luck. One morning on a work break he became incoherent and had to be taken by ambulance to a Medford hospital. He was treated for sun stroke and sent back to work. When his symptoms returned, he saw another doctor and was treated for heat stroke. When he still did not improve, Rod left Medford and went to live with June&#x2019;s family in the big house in Oakland. He recovered but was told not to resume any kind of hard, physical outdoor work. The lumber business was over for him. He would never return to the Northwest.<br><br>I was carried to full term, according to the birth records, and I was a normal, healthy child, delivered early in the morning by a doctor named John Henry. I was a big baby&#x2014;nine pounds and twenty-four inches long. (I come by that naturally. My parents were both big. My mother was six feet and my father was six feet three inches. My younger brother, Brian, is six feet ten inches.) Photo- graphs of me when I was a baby show a big, goofy-looking infant with bright eyes and a healthy appetite. In one picture I am reaching out for a slice of cake. My father says I was a cheerful, happy, friendly baby who was doted upon by his mother.<br><br>They gave me my grandfather&#x2019;s adopted American name&#x2014;Howard August Dully. To this day my uncle Kenneth says I&#x2019;m the one Dully who looks most like him.<br><br>My father&#x2019;s occupation was listed on my birth certificate as &#x201c;Talley man, Southern Sugar Pine Lumber Co., Medford, Ore.&#x201d; But he never went back to that job. After my birth, he moved his new family into a one-bedroom apartment at Spartan Village, a low-income student-housing complex near San Jose State University. He got a sales job at San Jose Lumber, a lumberyard right down the street from our apartment, and resumed his studies at the university.<br><br>I have very few memories of living at Spartan Village. The clearest one is a memory of fear. There was a playground there and my dad built me a choo-choo train out of fifty-gallon oil drums and lumber. I was proud of it, and proud that my dad had built it.<br><br>But there was a big, open field of weeds next to the apartment complex. I was afraid of that field. I was afraid of what was in those weeds. There was a low place in the center of the field that kids would run into and disappear. I was afraid they wouldn&#x2019;t come out. I knew that if I went into that field I would fall in and not be able to come out. It&#x2019;s the first thing in my life I remember being afraid of.<br><br>In August 1951, when I was two and a half years old, Rodney and June had another son. They named him Brian. Like me, he was born healthy. I now had a roommate in our Spartan Village apartment.<br><br>In some families, the arrival of the second son is the end of the world for the first son, because now he has to share his mother with a stranger. Not in my family. My dad said Brian&#x2019;s birth did not have any impact on my close relationship with June. He was responsi- ble for Brian, while she concentrated all her love on me. &#x201c;I was the one taking care of Brian,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;All she cared about was little Howard.&#x201d;<br><br>My father told me later that I was the most important person in my mother&#x2019;s life&#x2014;more important, even, than him. I was the number-one son. &#x201c;I could&#x2019;ve dropped dead and it wouldn&#x2019;t have made a bit of difference,&#x201d; my dad said. &#x201c;She had you.&#x201d;<br><br>When he completed his degree, my father was hired as an elementary school teacher in a one-room schoolhouse in a little town called Pollock Pines in the Sierras, about halfway between Sacramento and Lake Tahoe.<br><br>Most of my early childhood memories come from this place. Our house sat on a hill that sloped down to a bend in Highway 50, the two-lane road that led from Sacramento to Lake Tahoe. We had a little cocker spaniel named Blackie. He was hit by a car on that road, and killed, when I was about two years old.<br><br>I also remember sitting in a coffee shop in Placerville, having a soda with my mother. We were waiting for my father. Music was playing.<br><br>My mother&#x2019;s uncle Ross and aunt Ruth had a huge mountain cabin, so big it was more like a hunting lodge, farther up Highway 50, near a famous old resort called Little Norway. It had been built by my great-grandfather&#x2014;Grandma Daisy&#x2019;s father&#x2014;in the 1930s. The main building, which was two stories and filled with moose heads, was surrounded by pine trees and smaller cabins that were so primitive they had dirt floors. We used to stay in one of them when I was little.<br><br>In the winter, the snow was so deep we cut steps in it and climbed onto the cabin roof. Later on I learned to ski there, but my earliest memories of the snow are unhappy ones. I stepped into a snow drift that was so deep I sank in up to my waist and couldn&#x2019;t get out. This frightened me. I thought some kind of snow monster was going to come and eat me, and I began to cry.<br><br>My father thought it was the funniest thing he&#x2019;d ever seen. I was terrified, but he was laughing. That made me mad at him.<br><br>I think I was a happy child. I remember walking the two blocks from our apartment to my father&#x2019;s work every day, my mother carrying the sack lunch she&#x2019;d made for him. But I also remember not liking the way my mother made me dress. I had to wear colored shirts, and those little shorts that have straps to hold them up. They looked like those German lederhosen. Even as a kid I thought they were lame. I probably wanted to wear blue jeans.<br><br>My mother liked being a mother and she took naturally to it. In my favorite picture of her from that time, she&#x2019;s wearing a cap-sleeve shirt, a wide black belt, and a billowing skirt, and she&#x2019;s standing under a clothesline in the Spartan Village yard. She looks like she&#x2019;s calling to me, and she looks happy.<br><br>Family members have told me that she enjoyed life and laughed a lot. She wasn&#x2019;t serious, like my dad. She was more carefree, and liked to have fun.<br><br>In my memory, she was a very loving and indulgent mother. I remember being held and hugged and kissed by her. I remember being loved. I have fleeting pictures in my head of green grass, of sunshine, of running past my mother&#x2019;s full skirts. I remember her laughing.<br><br>My father was ...</p><h2>Are You Confused?</h2><p>Would You Like to Know... *What is man&#39;s best diet for optimal health? *High or Low protein diet-Which is better? *How arthritis and cancer are successfully treated in Europe *The truth about nutrition-sex relationship? *What is the real cause of baldness? *How to fast-and how not to? *Is milk good for your health? *Should you take vitamins and food supplements? *Must you drink distilled water? *How to protect yourself against polluted air? *Should you eat meat? *What can fermented foods do for your health? *How certain health foods can harm you? *The truth about rejuvenating herbs? *Why is Vitamin X called &#34;the youth vitamin?&#34; *Can aging be prevented or postponed? *What is health and rejuvenation secret number one?

VERDICT: Full of intrigue, the latest entry in the action-packed thriller series (after 'Edge of Apocalypse' and 'Thunder of Heaven') by LaHaye, co-author of the best-selling 'Left Behind' prophecy series, and Parshall ('Chamber of Justice' series) will appeal to fans of spiritual thrillers by T. Davis Bunn. -- Library Journal <br><br> (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>In fine Ironman-meets-the-Rapture style, LaHaye (Left Behind series) and Parshall add a third volume to The End series of political apocalyptic thrillers. Weapons specialist Joshua Jordan is narrowing down who he thinks may be the anti-Christ when the Rapture, the belief that faithful followers of Christ are snatched away to heaven before the end of the world, arrives, and he must prepare a protege, Ethan March, his assistant and a former pilot, for the time of tribulation to come. Joshua's wife, Abigail, defends him against false charges that led to his exile from the U.S. Joshua and other followers of Christ wage battle with divine intervention against the powers of darkness and convince people to join Christ's side. Characters teach predictive prophecy as they hurtle through the fast-paced worldwide quest to save as many people as possible from doom. Quick pacing and a heart-pounding resolution lead to a dynamic scene of the afterlife and a cliffhanger for the next book.

As a teenager, she always wished her feet were small and delicate, and tried to cram them into shoes that were several sizes too small. Later, when she read the story of Cinderella to her kindergarten classes, she wondered how anyone could run in glass slippers, much less dance in them. <p> Now the author of several books for children, Ellen lives in Santa Barbara, California, where she has gladly forgotten the recipes for dozens of ways to make tuna casserole.</p>Gr. 2-4. In picture-book format, this introduces the winter solstice customs and beliefs of the ancient Britons, Scandinavians, Romans, and Peruvians, as well as certain Native American sun ceremonies. Jackson also explains how to demonstrate the earth's tilt using an orange and a flashlight; she connects ancient solstice practices to modern customs associated with Christmas and Hanukkah, and she ends the book with an adaptation of a Cherokee creation tale. Teachers will value the book's multicultural approach as well as its simple, readable text and attractive watercolor illustrations. While the introduction to the science of solstice could be fuller and the accompanying illustrations much more precise, the book definitely fills a niche. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>A Thousand Bones</h2><p><b><br> A woman cop. <br> <br> A haunting memory.... <br> </b> <br> <br> The only female detective in the Miami PD's Homicide division, Joe Frye has memories that haunt her, and a past that not even her lover, detective Louis Kincaid, truly knows. It began when Joe was an ambitious rookie cop in a small Michigan town called Echo Bay.... <br> <br> The bones found in the woods were the first clue in a string of unimaginably brutal murders of young women. Plunged into a heated investigation -- and caught between the dictates of a reluctant local sheriff and the state police -- Joe soon uncovers the chilling truth: In the dead of winter in the Michigan woods, she must face down a predator who has chosen <i>her</i> as a worthy opponent -- or become his next victim.</p><p><b>P. J. Parrish</b> is actually two sisters&#x2014;Kristy Montee and Kelly Nichols&#x2014;who pooled their talents and their lifelong love of writing to create the character of Louis Kincaid. Their <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA TODAY</i> bestselling novels include <i>An Unquiet Grave</i>, <i>A Killing Rain</i>, <i>Island of Bones</i>, <i>Thicker Than Water</i>, <i>Paint It Black</i>, <i>Dead of Winter</i>, and <i>Dark of the Moon</i>. They are also the authors of a standalone thriller, <i>The Killing Song</i>.Parrish uses his last, stunning Louis Kincaid novel (2006's <i>An Unquiet Grave</i>) as a jumping-off point for Kincaid's lover Joe Frye, the lone female homicide detective in the Miami-Dade Police Department. Told in flashback, Frye recounts her investigation of serial murders 13 years earlier, in 1975. Frye's uneventful rookie year in the Leelanau County, Mich., sheriff's department undergoes a drastic change with the discovery of human bones in the woods of Echo Bay. Soon, the discovery of more bones and a multitude of artifacts point police to the conclusion that the remains belong to more than one victim. Mysterious Native American glyphs carved into a tree nearby provide the lead Frye needs&#x2014;if only she could decipher where they're taking her. Even after the clues fall carefully into place, revealing the killer's identity and pushing Frye into his sights, the book continues to sizzle with taut suspense and the promise of a tumultuous conclusion. Keen attention to detail and thorough character development get equal billing with scintillating thrills, giving Parrish another top-notch whodunit that just may leave fans thinking, Louis who? <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He lives in an old house built on an Indian mound in Pineland, Florida.&nbsp;<p>THE DAY I met the Bahamian woman who claimed to be my sister, and less than an hour before I was shot during the attempted kidnapping of a diplomat's daughter, my eccentric friend Tomlinson said to me, "Know how desperate I am? I'm thinking of having Elmer Fudd tattooed on my ass. Seriously, the cartoon character. You know who I'm talking about? The chubby guy with the red hunting cap, the one with the shotgun."</p><p>My eccentric, drug-modified friend Tomlinson.</p><p>I was lying in a hammock, leafing through a very old issue of <i>Copeia, Journal of the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.</i> It contained an article on Gulf sturgeon, written back in the days when the occasional sturgeon was still caught in saltwater south of Tampa Bay. I paused long enough to straighten my glasses and stare at him. "You're kidding. From the Bugs Bunny cartoons? Even a regular tattoo, I've never understood the motivation. Something like you're talking about, I just can't comprehend."</p><p>"I told you about the...difficulty I've been having."</p><p>Yes, he had. Over and over he'd told me. Which is why I thought: <i>Boy oh boy oh boy, here we go again.</i></p><p>"I <i>did</i> tell you, didn't I?"</p><p>"Yes, and I don't care to hear any more about your personal problems. It's sunset. In your own words: The Mellow Yellow Hour. I'm trying to relax before I change shoes and run. Don't screw with the molecular harmony--again, your words."</p><p>"I know, I know, but this is serious."</p><p>"So you keep saying."</p><p>"<i>Anything</i> that concerns Zamboni and the Hat Trick Twins is serious. They're just not theirselves, man."</p><p>Zamboni and the Twins--my friend's private name for his private equipment.</p><p>He explained, "The inflatable monster has finally turned all control over to my brain's moral guidance system, which is like a stone cold downer." He made a fizzling, whistling sound. "Sooner or later, it happens to every man, right?...<i>Right?"</i></p><p>It was the fourth, maybe fifth time he'd asked me that question, but when a friend fishes for reassurance, you must reassure. "Of course. Very few exceptions."</p><p>"Okay, so you at least have a minor understanding of the motive behind the tattoo. Picture it"--Tomlinson created a frame with his huge, bony hands--"Elmer Fudd on the cheek of my ass, aiming his shotgun toward the shadows and he's saying, 'Come outta there you wascally wabbit!' Lots of bold color, reds and greens, but still...<i>tasteful.</i> Something that lightens the mood but also makes a statement."</p><p>I was nodding. "Yeah, choose the wrong shades, a tattoo like that could seem almost frivolous."</p><p>"Sarcasm. My equipment hasn't worked dependably in more than two months, yet my <i>compadre</i> offers sarcasm."</p><p>"Only because it's such a ridiculous idea. I still don't understand the motivation. Or maybe you're just joking."</p><p>We were on the second-floor veranda of a tin-roofed house, eye level with palm fronds and coconuts. Looking downward through the palms, we could see clay tennis courts, a swimming pool, sugar-white beach, and bay. Florida's Gulf Coast has a couple of exclusive, members-only islands. Guava Key is the one you read about occasionally, always associated with the very rich and rigorously private. The island is south of Tampa, north of Naples: a hundred acres of manicured rainforest and private homes centered on a turn-of-the-century fishing lodge built on an Indian mound. It is an island with no roads, no bridges, no cars and no strip malls, so it has the feel of a solid green raft at sea--boat and helicopter access only.</p><p>We were on Guava Key as guests of management. Tomlinson, an ordained Rinzai Zen Master and Buddhist priest, was there to teach a moneyed few members a course called "Beginner's Mind," which, I knew from our long association, has to do with Zen meditation and breathing techniques. I have no interest in meditation, nor do I feel the need to take vacations. Life in my little Sanibel Island stilthouse, collecting marine specimens to study and sell, is sufficiently satisfying. Plus, I tend to fret about my fish tank and aquaria if I'm gone for more than a few days. In them are delicate creatures that interest me, such as immature tarpon, sea anemones, and squid--fascinating animals that require a lot of care. Even so, he'd pestered me about tagging along until I finally lost patience. I told him enough was enough. Unless he came up with a good and practical reason for me to leave my work and go to Guava Key, drop the subject, damn it!</p><p>I should have learned by now never to refuse one of Tomlinson's invitations by invoking a preferred alternative. He's probably right when he says that I'm obsessive. I'm almost certainly right in my belief that he's manic. When the man becomes fixated, nothing can untrack him.</p><p>What he did was hunt around until he came up with a gambit that was professionally compelling and made too much sense for me to say no. It turned out that the state required Guava Key Inc. to file periodic fish counts from adjacent waters, all data to be assembled by an accredited marine biologist--something to do with past zoning variances. As owner and lone employee of Sanibel Biological Supply, I am an accredited, independent biologist for hire. He'd contacted management, and management had offered me a generous figure, all expenses paid, for myself and a guest. Jeth Nicholes had already assured Tomlinson that he and his girlfriend, Janet Mueller, would keep an eye on my stilthouse and feed my fish, so I had no choice but to accept.</p><p>Finding an appropriate guest, though, turned out to be more difficult than you might imagine.</p><p>The first person I called was Dewey Nye, the former tennis star. Dewey and I are old friends. For a time, we were on-again, off-again lovers. On-again, off-again until we both realized that the chemistry was wrong, quite literally. Mostly, though, she is my all-time favorite workout partner. By telephone, we agreed that, after the holiday season just past, a couple of Spartan weeks on Guava Key was just what we needed to shed a few pounds and cleanse our systems.</p><p>"Every morning," she told me, "we'll do a long swim, then a kickass run. Really push the envelope. Finish everything at P-squared."</p><p>I had to ask. "P-squared? What's P-squared?"</p><p>"I keep forgetting what an out-of-touch old hulk you really are. So I'll be delicate. It's jock for 'Upchuck pace.' Only, the first P doesn't stand for upchuck."</p><p>"Ah."</p><p>"They've got a health club? So we lift weights heavy every other day, then limit ourselves to two, maybe three cocktails in the evening. Our own little basic training retreat. After New Year's in New Jersey--it's been gray and sleeting for like twenty damn days in a row--after a couple weeks of this, shut up indoors with Rita, her poodle and her aluminum Christmas tree, I'm not sure who or what's gonna die first: my holiday spirit, or that damn yapping dog. What I need is a serious dose of Florida heat."</p><p>But five days before she was to fly in from Newark, Dewey's roommate, Rita Santoya, suffered an all-too-familiar bout of jealousy. Latin men are said to be possessive. It's an unfair generalization, yet Latin woman, apparently, can be just as bad as their clich�d counterparts. After a series of quarrels, Rita issued an ultimatum: If Dewey visited me in Florida, there was no need for her to come back.</p><p>As always, Dewey acquiesced.</p><p>"Maybe next time, Doc, when Rita feels a little more secure in our relationship. Don't worry, we'll get together again."</p><p>I told Dewey, any time, lady, any time, knowing there would probably never be a next time.</p><p>Male or female, the possessive ones never feel secure. Nor do their mates.</p><p>So I went through the short list: Dr. Kathleen Rhodes, but she was back in the Yucatan, doing field work. Nora Chung was available, but now had a romantic interest in a solicitous, sympathetic physician and didn't want to risk burdening the relationship so early in the game. Erin Bostwick was already scheduled to work the late shift all month at Timbers; Sally Minster (formerly Sally Carmel) was in the process of divorcing the neurotic abuser she'd married, but didn't feel right about slipping away with me until the legalities were complete.</p><p>She was disappointed. "I've had a crush on you since I was, what? Eight years old? Since the days you were living with your crazy uncle Tucker Gatrell, the dear sweet man, on that funky little mangrove ranch of his. So now you call."</p><p>Here's one of the ironies of male-female association: With women of sufficient character and humor, it takes only a few weeks to forge an intimate relationship, yet their well-being remains a matter of concern even years after parting. Their dilemmas still squeeze the heart.</p><p>One night, I found myself in my little lab, sitting beneath the goose-neck lamp, making a list of desperate last-minute replacement ladies. Thankfully, I caught myself. I've reached a stage in my life in which the little social interaction I have is guided by a simple maxim: I'd rather be alone than with people with whom I feel no emotional connection. That includes women.</p><p>Solitude is much preferred to the more disturbing isolation of sharing loneliness with a stranger.</p><p>I made no more telephone calls.</p><p><b>&#x2014;</b>Reprinted from&nbsp;<b>Shark River</b>&nbsp;by Randy Wayne White by permission of Berkley, a member of Penguin Putnam Inc.

And if need be, he'll even start a small revolution . . .</p></p><p><p>Lawrence Block is one of the most widely recognized names in the mystery genre. He has been named a Grand Master of the Mystery Writers of America and is a four-time winner of the prestigious Edgar and Shamus Awards, as well as a recipient of prizes in France, Germany, and Japan. He received the Diamond Dagger from the British Crime Writers' Association&#x2014;only the third American to be given this award. He is a prolific author, having written more than fifty books and numerous short stories, and is a devoted New Yorker and an enthusiastic global traveler.</p>Block introduced Evan Tanner, specialist in lost political causes, in this rousing, often comic 1966 yarn. Unable to sleep for 15 years following a Korean War head wound, Tanner devotes his considerable free time to reading, learning languages, and turning his affliction into a livelihood by writing theses and dissertations for graduate students in New York. Then he learns of hidden Armenian gold in Turkey and sets off on an unlikely adventure that makes him the most wanted fugitive in the world as well as the accidental leader of a Macedonian revolt. Block's tale gets off to an engaging start, sags in the middle partly because of some bone-jarring violence, and recovers neatly at the end.

But Amanda Broadmoor resolves to remain in Rochester to help control the spread of the dreaded disease. However, much more than Amanda&#39;s health hangs in the balance.

Will she be forced to marry a man she disdains in order to save the Broadmoor legacy?</p><p>Amanda raced up the steps and into her bedroom. Slamming the door behind her, she leaned against the cool wood and wrapped her arms around her waist. For a short time her breath heaved in short, rapid bursts, then slowed to a more normal rate. Her dreams of love collided with the reality of Ellert Jackson, and she wondered if she could possibly marry him. Perhaps he would be willing to wait until they gained a better understanding of each other. She pressed her knuckles to her mouth at the thought of marriage to someone so old--a complete stranger. A knock sounded on the door, and she jumped in surprise. &#34;Who is it?&#34; There was a quiver in her voice. &#34;It&#39;s your mother. May I come in?&#34; Her mother didn&#39;t wait for a response. Instead, she was across the threshold and into the room before Amanda could answer. &#34;I know this is more than you should be required to bear, and I&#39;m so very sorry.&#34; She wrapped Amanda in a warm embrace and then stepped back and looked her directly in the eyes. &#34;Not all marriages that begin as arrangements are unhappy.

(Newsweek magazine) begins with a birth in an African village in 1750, and ends two centuries later at a funeral in Arkansas. And in that time span, an unforgettable cast of men, women, and children come to life, many of them based on the people from Alex Haley's own family tree.<br><br>When Alex Haley was a boy growing up in Tennessee, his grandmother used to tell him stories about their family, stories that went way back to a man she called "the African" who was taken aboard a slave ship bound for Colonial America. As an adult, Alex Haley spent twelve years searching for documentation that might authenticate what his grandmother had told him. In an astonishing feat of genealogical detective work, he discovered the name of "the African"--Kunta Kinte, as well as the exact location of the village in West Africa from where he was abducted in 1767.<br><br>While Haley created certain unknown details of his family history, ROOTS is definitely based on the facts of his ancestry, and the six generations of people--slaves and freedmen, farmers and lawyers, an architect, teacher--and one acclaimed author--descended from Kunte Kinte. But with this book, Haley did more than recapture the history of his own family. He popularized genealogy for people of all races and colors; and in so doing, wrote one of the most important and beloved books of all time, a true Modern Classic.</p><p>The monumental bestseller!

In 1914, on the eve of world war, they controlled the destiny of Europe and the fates of millions of their subjects. The outcome and their personal endings are well known&#x2015;Nicky shot with his family by the Bolsheviks, Willy in exile in Holland, Georgie still atop his throne. Largely untold, however, is the family saga that played such a pivotal role in bringing the world to the precipice.</p><p>Drawing widely on previously unpublished royal letters and diaries, made public for the first time by Queen Elizabeth II, Catrine Clay chronicles the riveting half century of the royals' overlapping lives, and their slow, inexorable march into conflict. They met frequently from childhood, on holidays, and at weddings, birthdays, and each others' coronations. They saw themselves as royal colleagues, a trade union of kings, standing shoulder to shoulder against the rise of socialism, republicanism, and revolution. And yet tensions abounded between them.</p><p>Clay deftly reveals how intimate family details had deep historical significance: the antipathy Willy's mother (Victoria's daughter) felt toward him because of his withered left arm, and how it affected him throughout his life; the family tension caused by Otto von Bismarck's annexation of Schleswig and Holstein from Denmark (Georgie's and Nicky's mothers were Danish princesses); the surreality surrounding the impending conflict. "Have I gone mad?" Nicholas asked his wife, Alexandra, in July 1914, showing her another telegram from Wilhelm. "What on earth does Willy mean pretending that it still depends on me whether war is averted or not?" Germany had, in fact, declared war on Russia six hours earlier. At every point in her remarkable book, Catrine Clay sheds new light on a watershed period in world history.</p></p><p><p>Catrine Clay has worked for the BBC for more than twenty years, directing and producing award-winning television documentaries. <i>King, Kaiser, Tsar</i> is her third book, resulting from her documentary of the same title. She is married and lives in London with her three children.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> How did WWI happen? Was it the inevitable product of vast, impersonal forces colliding? Or was it a completely avoidable war that resulted from flawed decisions by individuals? Clay (<i>Princess to Queen</i>), a documentary producer for the BBC, inclines strongly to the latter explanation, and she brilliantly narrates how just three men led their nations to war. Forming a trade union of majesties, King George V (Britain), Kaiser Wilhelm II (Germany) and Czar Nicholas II (Russia) were cousins who together ruled more than half the world. They were a family, and thus subject to the same tensions and turmoil that afflict every family. They had "played together, celebrated each other's birthdays... and later attended each other's weddings," but still, while George and Nicholas were close, Wilhelm was something of an outsider&#x2014;a feeling exacerbated by his paranoia and self-loathing. Over time, his sense of exclusion and humiliation would avenge itself on the family and eventually contributed strongly to the murder of Nicholas and the loss of his own throne. Clay's theory does have a hole&#x2014;though not ruled by the "cousins," France and Austria-Hungary also played major roles in the outbreak of war&#x2014;but that does not detract from the ingenuity and pleasure of her narrative. 35 b&amp;w photos. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

James Atlas, the celebrated chronicler of Saul Bellow and Delmore Schwartz, takes us back to his own childhood in suburban Chicago, where he fell in love with literature and, early on, found in himself the impulse to study writers&#x2019;&nbsp;lives. We meet Richard Ellmann, the great biographer of James Joyce and Atlas&#x2019;s professor during a transformative year at Oxford. We get to know Atlas&#x2019;s first subject, the &#x201c;self-doomed&#x201d; poet Delmore Schwartz. And we are introduced to a bygone cast of intellectuals such as Edmund Wilson and Dwight Macdonald (the &#x201c;tall pines,&#x201d; as Mary McCarthy once called them, cut down now, according to Atlas, by the &#x201c;merciless pruning of mortality&#x201d;) and, of course, the elusive Bellow, &#x201c;a metaphysician of the ordinary.&#x201d; <br><br>Atlas revisits the lives and works of the classical biographers, the Renaissance writers of what were then called &#x201c;lives,&#x201d; Samuel Johnson and the obsessive Boswell, and the Victorian masters Mrs. Gaskell and Thomas Carlyle. And in what amounts to a pocket history of his own literary generation, Atlas celebrates the biographers who hoped to glimpse an image of them&#x2014;&#x201c;as fleeting as a familiar face swallowed up in a crowd.&#x201d;<br><br><i>(With black-and-white illustrations throughout)</i></p><p><p><b>JAMES ATLAS</b>&nbsp;is the author of <i>Bellow: A Biography; Delmore Schwartz: The Life of an American Poet</i>&nbsp;(nominated for the National Book Award); and the memoir <i>My Life in the Middle Ages: A Survivor&#x2019;s Tale.</i> The founder of the Lipper/Viking Penguin Lives series, Atlas was for many years an editor at <i>The New York Times</i>, first at the book review and later at the magazine. His work has appeared in <i>The New Yorker, The Atlantic, The New York Review of Books, Vanity Fair,&nbsp;</i>and other journals. He lives in New York City.</p>I read biographies with the absorption of a car mechanic, repair manual in hand, peering under the hood at a steaming engine: <i>What&#x2019;s gone wrong here? And how do I fix it? </i>In order to write a biography, I had to know how the thing was done.<br> &nbsp;<br> I read without system the massive multivolume biographies: Leslie Marchand&#x2019;s <i>Byron, </i>Joseph Blotner&#x2019;s <i>Faulkner, </i>Richard Sewall&#x2019;s <i>Emily Dickinson. </i>P. N. Furbank&#x2019;s two volumes on Forster occupied me for weeks. I snailed through them pen in hand, scribbling notes in the mar�gins. I had the British edition, published by Secker &amp; Warburg,&#x2020; with a painted portrait of Forster as a young man on the cover in a crisp gray suit, seated in a willfully casual pose that somehow managed to intimate his timidity, and a quote from Pindar on the back that was a favorite of Forster&#x2019;s: &#x201c;Man&#x2019;s life is a day. What is he, what is he not? Man is the dream of a shadow. But when the god-given brightness comes a bright light is among men, and an age that is gentle come to birth.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The most compelling details, I began to notice, were the ones that instantly made you want to flip to the citations at the back in order to find out where they came from. At lunch with the historian G. M. Trevelyan, who talked a great deal but ate nothing, Forster brooded about the food: &#x201c;On his own plate, in the middle of a very warm help�ing of lukewarm mince, mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts, was one sprout which was quite raw, and he kept wondering, as the inspiring torrent poured over him, &#x2018;What a very curious thing. How could it have got in? And how impossible to interest my host in the subject.&#x2019; &#x201d; Where could the biographer have possibly dug up this odd tidbit? I flipped eagerly to the notes in the back, only to find . . . no note! The meditation on the raw sprout was on page 70, but there was a barren tundra of notelessness that stretched all the way from page 44 to 77. I clucked in frustration. Why was it so often the most salient bits that went unsourced? And always without apology&#x2014;no explanation of why the very citation you had interrupted your reading to look up had gone missing. Why did biographers, so conscientious that their notes often took up fifty or even a hundred pages of text, feel they had the right to blithely omit the origins of some obscure and tantalizing&#x2014;tantalizing <i>because </i>obscure&#x2014;detail? The sprout that arrested Forster&#x2019;s attention, for instance: had Furbank gleaned it from someone&#x2019;s journal? A letter? A report on the lunch to a friend, who put it in <i>his </i>journal? And why did it matter? In part, I suppose, because it was a feat of research: how could the biographer possibly know this?<br> &nbsp;<br> Furbank is especially good on his subject&#x2019;s physical features, which he registered with unpitying specificity. That Forster had &#x201c;a queer pedan�tic tic of speech&#x201d; was the least of it. The most damaging descriptions were supplied by the subject himself. An entry from Forster&#x2019;s journal, written when he was forty-six: &#x201c;red nose enormous, round patch in mid�dle of scalp . . . Face is toad-like . . . The anus clotted with hairs.&#x201d; (And how was this proctological detail obtained? One doesn&#x2019;t want to know.)<br> &nbsp;<br> Then there was the milieu&#x2014;the social world, the ancillary charac�ters, the manner of dress and traits of speech. The rector of Stevenage, Mr. Jowitt, &#x201c;a genial, out-of-doors style of parson, who rode to hounds&#x201d;; Forster&#x2019;s tutor, Oscar Browning, who napped while Forster read his weekly essays, a red handkerchief draped over his face; R. C. Trevelyan, the brother of G. M., who fancied himself a poet and &#x201c;lived his chosen part wholeheartedly, striding about the country with a knapsack, his hair flying, or writing poems in a furrow&#x201d;: it&#x2019;s E. M. Forster and His World that Furbank wants to evoke, a particular stratum of English society that he depicts with anthropological exactitude. He shows us the house in Abinger where Forster waited out World War II, &#x201c;an intensely old-fashioned household&#x201d; with no electricity or phone or baths; Agnes, the &#x201c;parlourmaid,&#x201d; who lugged hot water up to the bedrooms in heavy brass cans; a church fund-raising pageant that contained &#x201c;ancient Brit�ons in skins gathering fuel in the Abinger woods&#x201d;&#x2014;a scene as alien to the American reader as a Nambikwara burial rite.<br> &nbsp;<br> I also had to consider how to start the book. In-the-beginning chro�nology was the safest course, especially after the reader had been forced to scrutinize one of those eye-glazing family trees that pref�ace so many biographies. The standard method would go something like . . . let me pull a book down from the shelf: &#x201c;Ann (b. 1747) was the daughter of William Cookson, a successful linen draper in Penrith, and of Dorothy, sister and heiress of James Crackenthorpe of Newbiggin Hall.&#x201d; This dry and unrewardingly informative sentence occurs on the first page of <i>William Wordsworth: A Life, </i>by Stephen Gill. No throat-clearing here, just a clipped let&#x2019;s-get-on-with-it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Or you could start, as Walter Jackson Bate did, with a general obser�vation: &#x201c;Samuel Johnson has fascinated more people than any other writer except Shakespeare.&#x201d; Bate&#x2019;s purpose here is to make it clear that, despite Johnson&#x2019;s great and universal fame, there is still much to say about him that is new (which, in this instance, there emphatically was). But I was looking for a more dramatic way into the narrative. I wanted, above all, to tell a story.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A writer of lives is allowed the imagination of form but not of fact,&#x201d; Leon Edel pronounced in <i>Principia Biographica, </i>his useful if some�what humorless edict on the limits of biography. The &#x201c;fact&#x201d; part I got (though I would come to question the whole notion that there <i>was </i>such a thing as fact). It had never occurred to me that the &#x201c;form&#x201d; could be so elastic&#x2014;that, in effect, you could construct a biography however you liked. Richard Holmes had a useful term for this method: &#x201c;nonfic�tion story-telling,&#x201d; biography that has &#x201c;a protagonist, a time-sequence, a plot, and a dramatic pattern of human cause and effect.&#x201d; <i>Nonfiction story-telling</i>: that&#x2019;s what I was after.<br> &nbsp;<br> Edel himself had gone about as far as you could in this direction. I couldn&#x2019;t stop reading his biography of James&#x2014;two thousand pages, five volumes in all. It went down easily; I ceased work on Delmore for two weeks while I gobbled it up. They were handsomely designed, handsomely made books, with comfortably large type and interleaved folios of photographs. I also liked the way Edel broke up the chapters into manageable size, then broke them up into still smaller bits sepa�rated by roman numerals; it didn&#x2019;t make you feel, as so many biogra�phies did, that you were traversing an arid desert of type. The narrative was well paced; clearly a lot of thought had gone into the beginnings and endings of sections. Most often he would start with a scene, as in the chapter on James&#x2019;s friendship with the minor writer Hugh Walpole: &#x201c;They faced each other for the first time in February 1909 when James came up to London to attend a matinee of <i>The High Bid </i>[a play by Wal�pole]. He gave the young Hugh dinner at the Reform Club.&#x201d; This terse stage-setting is followed up with an entry from Walpole&#x2019;s diary; then a letter from James to Walpole. On their first weekend together at Lamb House, the power of James&#x2019;s presence renders Hugh mute&#x2014;normally a problem for a biographer but not in the case of the energetic Edel, who conjectures that &#x201c;if he did not speak in his diary,&#x201d; we can turn to a tale of Walpole&#x2019;s called &#x201c;Mr. Oddy,&#x201d; in which &#x201c;the emotion of their meeting&#x201d; is represented. Here the obese novelist, &#x201c;his large Johnso�nian body set on his short legs,&#x201d; is evoked both in his physical form and in his speech, inflected with &#x201c;the reverberation of the late style.&#x201d; Note Edel&#x2019;s agility in giving Walpole the space to invent&#x2014;to write fiction&#x2014;while at the same time making the connection between James and Walpole&#x2019;s fictive protagonist unambiguous. This is how James spoke, he&#x2019;s informing us; it &#x201c;rings true.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Collecting the data wasn&#x2019;t even the hardest part. As Boswell noted, it was putting the thing together that really took it out of you. The biographies on my shelves were finished products, printed and bound: there were no facsimiles of biography like the facsimile of <i>The Waste Land, </i>with its cross-outs and additions, whole stanzas revised word by word. I would pick up a handsome finished book&#x2014;say, volume three of Marchand&#x2019;s <i>Byron</i>&#x2014;and marvel at its beauty as a physical object. The elegant cover with its drawing of the poet, the glossy paper of the illustrations insert, the sewn binding, the rough-cut pages: it was a joy to hold in the hand. But it yielded no directives as to how the contents had been made. That I would have to learn for myself.<br> &nbsp;<br> As with any trauma, the emotional and physical pain caused by the composition of a biography fades over time. The letter misfiled, the tape recorder that failed to record (this was one reason I took notes), the quote you&#x2019;d forgotten to write down and now couldn&#x2019;t find: these lapses a biographer could weather. But what happened when you sat down to write?</p><h2>Louise Hay Gift Book Collection</h2><p>This beautifully illustrated three-book set by bestselling author and lecturer Louise L.

His best poems, with their grace and intelligence, not only stand as a rebuke to most of the glib work of his time, but remain among the finest examples of the midcentury American lyric.

While quietly wrestling with what it meant to be a black American artist at mid-century, Bearden opened himself to a world of cultural influences. He found inspiration in Benin bronzes and paintings by Duccio; the Bible and Buddhism; <i>The Odyssey</i> and the blues; contemporary urban life and the rural lore of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. <i>The Art of Romaire Bearden</i> offers a wise and thoughtful assessment of Bearden in the social context of his life and times. In the graceful lead essay, Ruth E. Fine traces Bearden's career from its beginnings in the mid-1930s, when&#x2014;as a newly-minted New York University grad&#x2014;he toiled by day as a social worker and painted at night. Bearden's best-known works are his Dada-influenced photomontages, begun in the mid-1960s, which created a visual equivalent for a disjunctive era of triumph and tragedy for African-Americans. His ou! tput also included stunning book illustrations and costume designs, political cartoons, incisive essays about the role of the black artist and even popular songs. More than 200 color illustrations display Bearden&#x2019;s coloristic wizardry as a master of painted collage and lyrical landscape. The book accompanies an exhibition assembled by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. (through Jan. 4, 2004) which travels to San Francisco, Dallas, New York and Atlanta. <i>&#x2014;Cathy Curtis</i>Ruth E.

Pieces are examined thoroughly for the techniques used in their manufacture, and their functions. Extensive explanations of the skills of the Khmer goldsmiths and the Khmer technology of gold working is given. Historical and cultural context is presented for better understanding and appreciation of the art objects, as well as an interpretation of gold s place in Khmer culture.</p><p>Khmer Gold is a ground-breaking study of the gold artifacts created by the Khmers who founded Cambodia , and their manufacturing techniques. The objects discussed are drawn from major public and private collections, pri�marily in Cambodia , Great Britain , Thailand and the United States . The identification of specific goldsmith ' s techniques, a subject sel�dom addressed in Khmer studies, reveals new evidence for surprising exotic cultural contacts that might have otherwise gone unrecognized. The authors also provide up-to-date geological information about the availability of gold in Cambodia , a territory that, in the past, has been considered metal-poor.<br><br>Gold permeated every aspect of Khmer elite life: aesthetic, artistic, economic, religious, political and social. The Khmer decorated their architecture with gold, and adorned both their own bodies and their sacred images with gold. Royal gifts insured the recipients ' loyalty and sacred offerings fashioned of gold to religious institutions insured divine protection for the kingdom.<br><br>New archaeological information and the recent discovery of Khmer Royal Regalia are beginning to reveal an originality and technical mastery that will result in an exciting appre�ciation of the Khmer goldsmith ' s art. The rare treasures that have survived lend credibility to ancient travelers ' tales of Khmer temples, sculpture, and royal bodies gleaming with gold that modern scholars and historians have long sought to confirm. Filled with fresh interpreta�tions of gold in Khmer culture, the book is a detailed and lavishly illustrated history of the high esteem in which gold was held in ancient Cambodia . Khmer Gold will be an important resource of all those interested in the cultures of Southeast Asia, especially that of the Khmer Kingdom. --Lookeast Magazine</p><h2>Tinker (Elfhome, Book 1)</h2><p>Inventor, girl genius Tinker lives in a near-future Pittsburgh which now exists mostly in the land of the elves.

When a pack of wargs chase an Elven noble into her scrap yard, life as she knows it takes a serious detour. Tinker finds herself taking on the Elven court, the NSA, the Elven Interdimensional Agency, technology smugglers and a college-minded Xenobiologist as she tries to stay focused on what&#39;s really important - her first date. Armed with an intelligence the size of a planet, steel-toed boots, and a junkyard dog attitude, Tinker is ready to kick butt to get her first kiss.</p><p>John W. Campbell Award Winner&nbsp;<b>Wen Spencer</b>&nbsp;resides in paradise in Hilo, Hawaii with two volcanoes overlooking her home. According to Spencer, she lives with "my Dalai Lama-like husband, my autistic teenage son, and two cats (one of which is recovering from mental illness).&nbsp; All of which makes for very odd home life at times." Spencer's love of Japanese anime and manga flavors her writing. Her novel&nbsp;<i>Tinker</i>&nbsp;won the 2003 Sapphire Award for Best Science Fiction Romance and was a finalist for the&nbsp;<i>Romantic Times</i>&nbsp;Reviewers' Choice Award for Fantasy Novel. Her&nbsp;<i>Wolf Who Rules</i>&nbsp;was a Top Pick by&nbsp;<i>Romantic Times</i>&nbsp;and given their top rating of four and a half stars.&nbsp; Other Baen books include&nbsp;<i>Endless Blue&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Eight Million Gods.</i>&nbsp;The Elfhome series includes&nbsp;<i>Tinker, Wolf Who Rules,&nbsp;</i><i>Elfhome, &nbsp;Wood Sprites&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Project Elfhome.</i>Wit and intelligence inform this off-beat, tongue-in-cheek fantasy from Spencer (Alien Taste, etc.), set in near-future Pittsburgh-or rather, the part of Pittsburgh that's been translated to the Faerie world of Elfhome by a faulty hyperphase gate created by the Chinese. After 18-year-old tech genius Tinker saves Windwolf, the elven governor of North America on Elfhome, from a pack of nasty wargs, Windwolf in gratitude turns her into an elf and makes her his consort. In her new and important position, Tinker becomes the target for a conspiracy of humans, elves and oni (Japanese demons that control their own part of Faerie) who are trying to build another gate for use in conquering Earth and Elfhome. Furious action, including a memorable car chase, good characterization, playful eroticism and well-developed folklore all help lift this well above the fantasy average. The routine jacket art, of an elven biological dirigible, probably won't help, but Buffy fans should find a lot to like in the book's resourceful heroine. FYI: Spencer has won the 2003 John W.

The revised and expanded edition of <b>Sheds</b> contains absolutely everything you need to know to design, build and enjoy the ultimate backyard shed. </p><p> Award-winning designer David Stiles helps you think through the issues involved in shed design, such as use, cost, placement and "degree of difficulty." Following a chapter on construction basics, he guides you through each step of building a simple 8 x 10-foot shed -- from foundation to cupola and everything in between. This core chapter includes a material list, step-by-step illustrated instructions and a daily labor schedule, as well as new information on timber framing and moving your shed to a different location. </p><p> The book then presents several basic sheds, along with a number of more complex special-use sheds, including a pool shed, an Irish garden shed, even a Japanese boat shed. The all-new storage shed on posts allows you to situate your building of a slope. </p><p> Packed with detailed illustrations, plans, commonsense advice and an inspiring selection of color photographs, <b>Sheds</b> is like having a consultant at your side as you work. Whether you are an average amateur builder or an ambitious expert, this book has something for you.</p></p><p><p> <b>David Stiles</b> is a designer'/builder and together, with his wife Jeanie, has authored fifteen books, including <i>Sheds: The Do-It-Yourself Guide,</i> Revised Edition (Firefly 1998), <i>The Treehouse Book</i> (which won the ALA Notable Children's Book Award), and <i>Playhouses You Can Build</i> (Firefly 1999). A graduate of the Pratt Institute and the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence, Italy, David is the winner of two awards from the New York Planning Commission for his designs for The Playground for All Children. </p><p> David and Jeanie's articles have appeared in several magazines and newspapers including <i>House Beautiful</i>, <i>Better Homes and Gardens</i>, <i>Country Living</i>, <i>Home Mechanix</i>, <i>Rebecca's Gardens</i>, and <i>The New York Times</i>. They have appeared on numerous television programs, including Lifetime Television <i>Our Home</i> and the Discovery Channel's <i>Home Matters</i> shows. They divide their time between New York City and East Hampton, N.Y. where they live in a barn which they renovated themselves. </p><p><b> Introduction </b></p><p> I have had a passion for building small structures since I was a kid. My first project, a clubhouse, ended in total failure because I did not know how to plan joints. Since then, I have built numerous treehouses, huts and forts. Now I have graduated to building sheds. Sheds, after all, are simply small houses, and many of the same principles apply to building both. If you plan on building your own house, you should definitely start by building a shed. This will not only test your building skills, but it will also give you a place to put your tools so they won't rust or get stolen. Even if you don't have such lofty homebuilding goals, a shed tailored to your needs and built by you and perhaps family and friends is a long-lasting, satisfying structure. </p><p> Let me dispel some common myths right away. Don't be misled by your neighbor saying, "You can build a shed in a weekend." All sheds take longer to build than you may think. To build anything right means you have to build it carefully; that takes time. How much time depends on your skills and the complexity of the shed you choose to build. A safe rule of thumb is to figure out the time required for each step and double it. </p><p> Another myth is that if you build the shed yourself, it won't cost anything. Not true. Even a doghouse will cost something in materials. Lumber is not cheap. You may be thinking of scavenging used lumber -- be aware that using old lumber of different sizes and strengths can lead to problems later on and may add unnecessary building time. </p><p> The shed you build yourself can be built better than any you may buy. You can build it to last a lifetime, you can build it to meet your exact requirements, you can build something you will be proud of. You can build a shed that will make you feel good every time you open the door and smell that unforgettable scent of real wood and see the shed that you put together with your own hands. </p><p> A recent study explored the success of home centers across the United States. The tool and hardware departments were getting a lot of business from "weekend carpenters." Most were business people who spent a large part of their lives in offices. The study found that what most of these people lacked in their lives was being able to have total control over a project and to feel the satisfaction that resulted from beginning the project and carrying it to completion themselves. Building a shed provides you with just that. </p><p> Building a shed is a big project and an activity that you should take pleasure in doing. In order to avoid mistakes and the frustration of trying to meet a deadline, allow plenty of time for completion. Make it an open-ended project that you can enjoy. </p><p> Any homeowner, especially those without a garage or basement, will be amazed what a difference a shed makes to their property. Not enough room for storage is one of homeowners' top complaints, according to the National Association of Home Builders. </p><p> Once you have completed a shed, you may find that your awareness of sheds has been elevated. As you drive through the countryside, your eye will unavoidably be drawn to people's yards, and you may quite naturally begin appraising the success or failure of other sheds. You may even feel inclined toward replacing that silver-framed photo of your trusting family dog with a color photo of your shed! </p><p> <i>Sheds</i> is different from the few other existing shed books or shed chapters in more general books, because it helps you get started thinking through what you want in your shed and then helps you design a shed to fit your needs. I begin with a compendium of construction techniques -- it helps to get familiar with these at the design stage and to refer to them again during actual building. The book continues with simple step-by-step, illustrated instructions for building a basic 8 x 10 shed from the bottom up. A section on a few more basic sheds is followed by a sampling of more complex special-use sheds whose designs come from hand-crafted outbuildings all over the world. I have included plans for all the sheds described in the book. I have purposely chosen designs with very different construction techniques and architectural features so that you can actually combine elements from various designs to create your custom-made shed. Perhaps you want to include the pole framing of the Japanese Boat Shed in your work shed along with the window of the Basic 8 x 10 Shed. The possibilities are endless. Finally, for the confident craftsperson and the dreamer there is a section of inspirational drawings and color photographs -- ideas to incorporate and ideas to build on. </p><p> <i>Sheds</i> is written for creative, hands-on homeowners with do-it-yourself experience in weekend projects and basic home repair. You should have at least a few building and repair projects under your tool belt, be ready to tackle medium-sized, challenging projects and be willing to stretch your carpentry skills for worthwhile accomplishments. </p></p><h2>Cromwell: The Lord Protector</h2><p>Explores the complexity of this enigmatic figure and analyzes his impact on the military and political environment of seventeenth-century England</p><p></p><h2>The Forgotten (Decker/Lazarus Novels)</h2><p>Having submitted for counseling a troubled wealthy teen who desecrated a synagogue with anti-Semitic graffiti, Rina Lazarus discovers there is more to the case when the boy and his therapist are found murdered and joins forces with her husband, LAPD Homicide Lieutenant Peter Decker, to uncover the truth. Reprint.</p><p>L.A. homicide detective Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus, his Orthodox Jewish wife, return in a new entry in this popular series. Faye Kellerman can be counted on to deliver emotional complexity along with suspense, and in <i>The Forgotten</i> it comes from the relationship between Peter and Jacob, Rina's troubled teenage son. Jacob has a personal connection to the event that sets off this intricately plotted novel, the defacing of Rina's synagogue by one of his classmates. Ernesto Golding can't explain why he vandalized the synagogue, but when he and his therapists are murdered months after the incident, Peter realizes that something the teenager told him when admitting his guilt may hold the key to the killings: Ernesto's belief that his grandfather may have been a Nazi who posed as a Jew to escape to South America after the war. Investigating Ernesto's story gives Rina a strand of the plot to tease out; meanwhile, Peter concentrates on another motive for the therapist murders that involves computer fraud, the College Board exams, and the high cost exacted by parents who pressure their teenagers to succeed.<p> Kellerman skillfully keeps the dramatic tension going as she pulls all the pieces of her complex plot together. But what makes this novel her best yet is her acutely revealing portrait of Jacob, struggling with the existential angst of adolescence as he attempts to reconcile his devotion to Judaism with the temptations of contemporary life, from drugs to sex. She brilliantly limns his search for identity, intimacy, and independence even as he redefines his relationship to Peter and Rina, in a scenario that resounds with psychological truth. <i>The Forgotten</i> is a terrific addition to the Kellerman oeuvre. While she's always been an exceptional illustrator of the emotional life of the family, this time she writes with an expertise that may owe something to professional insights of her husband, author Jonathan Kellerman, who's also a child psychologist. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><p>Faye Kellerman lives with her husband, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Jonathan Kellerman, in Los Angeles, California, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. </p></p><h2>Mr. Campion&#39;s Abdication (An Albert Campion Mystery, 4)</h2><p><b><i>&#x2018;So where exactly did Albert Campion stand on the Abdication?&#x2019; &#x2018;Behind the throne, slightly to the left?&#x2019; suggested Commander Charles Luke.</i></b><br><br> Margery Allingham&#x2019;s Mr Campion finds himself masquerading as technical advisor to a very suspicious but glamorous Italian film producer and her crew hunting for buried treasure that never was in the Suffolk village of Heronhoe near Pontisbright which used to host trysts between Edward VIII and Mrs Wallis Simpson.<br><br> &#x2018;When it came to the Abdication Crisis in &#x2019;36 those dirty week-ends in Heronhoe were quickly forgotten, except not by the Prince.

Clearly, their most precious cargo was the Bible. Have you ever wondered what version of the Bible the Pilgrims brought to America on the Mayflower? Believe it or not, it was not the King James Version of 1611. It was actually the 1599 Geneva Bible - a forgotten yet priceless treasure. The Geneva Bible, printed over 200 times between 1560 and 1644, was the most widely read and influential English Bible of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This superb translation was the product of the best Protestant scholars of the day and became the Bible of choice for many of the greatest writers, thinkers, and historical figures of that time. Men such as Shakespeare, John Bunyan, and John Milton used the Geneva Bible, and it was reflected in their writings. During the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell issued a pamphlet containing excerpts from the Geneva Bible to his troops. William Bradford cited the Geneva Bible in his book Of Plymouth Plantation. The Geneva Bible is unique among all other Bibles. It was the first Bible to use chapters and numbered verses and became the most popular version of its time because of the extensive marginal notes. These notes, written by Reformation leaders such as John Calvin, John Knox, Miles Coverdale, William Whittingham, Anthony Gilby, and others, were included to explain and interpret the scriptures for the common people. For nearly half a century these notes helped the people of England, Scotland, and Ireland understand the Bible and true liberty. King James despised the Geneva Bible because he considered the notes on key political texts to be seditious and a threat to his authority. Unlike the King James Version, the Geneva Bible was not authorized by the government. It was truly a Bible by the people and for the people. You can see why this remarkable version with its profound marginal notes played a key role in the formation of the American Republic. Sadly, 407 years after its original publication, this wonderful version of the Bible has been nearly forgotten. The only complete version available today is a large, cumbersome, and difficult-to-read facsimile edition. A facsimile edition contains pictures of the original pages. The small print and the older English letters and spellings make it nearly impossible to read or study. If the 1599 Geneva Bible is to survive the passing of time and be remembered for generations to come, it must be resurrected and redistributed.

More than any other group, artists feel impelled to create, and this urge brings them closer to God. By contemplating the creative drive of humanity, we can better understand the works of God, and by reading deeply into the tenets of Christianity, we can better understand the creative spirit of man. Dorothy L. Sayers explores the concept of the Holy Trinity within the context of invention: the creative idea, the creative energy, and the creative power. In this searching, wide-ranging treatise, one of the greatest minds of the twentieth century shows us what it means to be an artist&#x2014;and what it takes to make humankind. Sayers was a renowned English crime writer, poet, playwright, essayist, translator, Christian humanist, and a student of classical and modern languages. She is best known for her mysteries, a series of novels and short stories set between the First and Second World Wars that feature English aristocrat and amateur sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey, that remain popular to this day. However, Sayers herself considered her translation of Dante&#x2019;s Divine Comedy to be her best work. She is also known for her plays, literary criticism and essays.</p><p>Best known for her Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries, Dorothy Sayers was also a playwright, essayist, and a translator of Dante. C.S. Lewis said that he liked her "for the extraordinary zest and edge of her conversation--as I like a high wind." The reader gets a fair taste of that wind in this book, her study of the human (and divine) creative process. Beginning with some stingingly humorous words for the education process (which has produced, she says, "a generation of mental slatterns") she then explores the Trinitarian nature of creativity. Here she identifies the Christian concept of the Holy Trinity--God, Son, Holy Spirit--with three elements of creation. First, the Idea: "passionless, timeless, beholding the whole work complete at once, the end in the beginning"; then the Creative Energy: "begotten of that idea, working in time from the beginning to end," manifesting the Idea in matter; and finally the Creative Power: "the meaning of the work and its response in the lively soul"--in essence, what she calls "the indwelling Spirit." <p> In a plain, matter-of-fact style that readers will recognize from her mysteries, she reflects on the question of free will and miracle, evil, and, ultimately, "the worth of the work." It is especially here, I think, in this final chapter that the book remains both timeless and profoundly timely. The artist stands for the true worker, she writes, who, while requiring payment for his work, as an artist "retains so much of the image of God that he is in love with his creation for its own sake." So too, ultimately, should it be for all human work: "That the eyes of all workers should behold the integrity of the work is the sole means to make that work good in itself and so good for mankind. This is only another way of saying that the work must be measured by the standard of eternity." <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p>This classic, with a new introduction by Madeleine L&#39;Engle, is by turns an entrancing meditation on language; a piercing commentary on the nature of art and why so much of what we read, hear, and see falls short; and a brilliant examination of the fundamental tenets of Christianity. The Mind of the Maker will be relished by those already in love with Dorothy L. Sayers and those who have not yet met her.</p><h2>The Book Tree: A Christian Reference for Children&#39;s Literature</h2><p>Literary affections naturally give way to literary habits.

Cultural practices which deform, adorn, mutilate, and obliterate the body illustrate that it is an important site for the inscription of culture.

Thoroughly conversant with the latest in feminist criticism, gender theory, and the predicaments of postmodern culture, the authors explore various narratives and images through which the gendered body is currently represented. <br><br>&#x201c;What makes this a coherent volume is the shared interest throughout the essays in the representation of the body surface (tattooing, perfuming, weightlifting) and body penetration (rape, torture) and the relationship of these matters to the issue of gender. This volume thus combines a theoretical sophistication with attention to a variety of fascinating case studies that illuminate the predicament of the body in postmodern culture.&#x201d; &#x2015; Howard Eilberg Schwartz, Stanford University</p><h2>For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow Is Enuf</h2><p>A theatrical celebration, in verse and prose, of being female and black incorporates the triumphs, joys, griefs, and losses of black women in America</p><p><b>Ntozake Shange,</b> poet, novelist, playwright, and performer, wrote the Broadway-produced and Obie Award-winning <i>For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf.</i> She has also written numerous works of fiction, including <i>Sassafras, Cypress and Indigo, Betsy Brown,</i> and <i>Liliane.</i><p></p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p></p><p></p><p><i>The stage is in darkness.

Eschewing the complications and corruptions of the civilized world, Heyerdahl planned to immerse himself in the "great anthropological mysteries" of Polynesia while living like a "primitive man . . . with keen instincts and all his senses alive." Circumstances conspired against Heyerdahl's idealistic notions, prompting him to return to Norway in early 1938. Yet his studies on the island helped give birth to the idea that Polynesia had been settled by people migrating by water from South America rather than from the west, as was commonly believed. Following Heyerdahl's voyage from Peru to Polynesia aboard the raft Kon-Tiki, this spirited volume highlights the explorer's attempt to prove his theory. The book also details his scouting, on subsequent expeditions, of "a link between cultures of Central America and those which had developed on the Nile, the Euphrates and . . . in the Indus Valley." Using extensive excerpts from Heyerdahl's own books, Ralling ( The Voyage of Charles Darwin ) has fashioned a stimulating chronicle of curiosity and wanderlust. Illustrated. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Part biography, part autobiography, this book, which accompanies a TV series on the life and work of the noted explorer and author, is intended to make Heyerdahl's scientific achievements accessible to the general reader. Profusely illustrated with photographs, the text includes many excerpts from Heyerdahl's diaries and published works and spans his life from his childhood in Norway to his present work in Peru. Heyerdahl's explorations in the Pacific, as well as his Ra and Tigris expeditions, are as engaging to read about as ever, and for that reason alone this book will have an audience. Ralling's writing, however, has the tone of promotional literature and underestimates the ability of general readers to draw their own conclusions about the material presented. Nevertheless, this book may serve as an introduction to those unfamiliar with Heyerdahl and his work.<br><i>- Joan W.

But Lori Arviso Alvord would leave the traditional hogans of her people to attend the prestigious Stanford University Medical School and become the first Navajo woman surgeon. Only after conquering the high-tech realm of the operating room would this extraordinarily talented doctor realize something was missing from contemporary medical care&#x2014;an understanding of the whole person who has come seeking healing.<br><br><b>The Scalpel and the Silver Bear</b> tells of Dr. Alvord's pioneering journey to become a woman surgeon, fighting the odds presented by her own culture and the unspoken rules that made surgery the territory of a privileged class of males. Then, having accomplished her dreams, the strong-willed young woman would find herself faced with a different challenge: learning another approach to medicine amid the Hataali, the medicine men of the Din�, the people we call Navajo.<br><br>Here in this moving, enlightening, and provocative volume, Dr. Alvord teaches us how she merged the latest breakthroughs of science and methodology with the ancient tribal paths to recovery and wellness. In dramatic encounters while practicing reservation medicine&#x2014;a man whose intestine was pierced by a porcupine quill, which he insisted was placed there by an enemy's curse; a woman who had been struck by lightning and blamed her cancer on it; an all-night winter sing for a gravely ill young woman, attended by the whole community&#x2014;Dr. Alvord witnessed the power of belief to influence health, for good or for ill. She discovered that patients undergoing chemotherapy did better after having a native healer at bedside, and that the feelings of both the patient and the surgeon could affect recovery time, postsurgical complications, and even whether the patient lived or died.<br><br>The secret, Lori Alvord discovered, lay in the Navajo philosophy of a balanced and harmonious life, called "Walking in Beauty." Her sharing of these ancient principles promises to have an immeasurable impact on today's doctors and patients by expanding the concept of mind-body healing to include the interconnectedness of all life.

She lives with her husband and children&nbsp;near San Francisco.<p> Chapter </p><p> <b>1</b> </p><p> </p><p> <i>September 20, 1990</i> </p><p> The law offices of Pohlmann, McIntyre, Sorensen andFrost surrounded a courtyard in a low, white-painted adobe building in the town of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. Lush flower bushes, pines, and succulents bedecked the hilly front yard where steps led to the main door. In the bright sun of mid-September the building looked overexposed, bleached like the sand on the beach at the foot of Ocean Avenue. Now, at ten in the morning, streams of Lexuses and Infinitis already cruised this side street, hungry for parking spaces. </p><p> Nina Reilly grabbed a pile of mail on the receptionist's desk. She had worked as a paralegal at the law firm for the past year, having snagged this coveted job simply by submitting a r�sum�. Her mother called it Irish luck, but Nina suspected it had more to do with another Irish character trait. Her father, Harlan, knew Klaus Pohlmann because he hobnobbed with everyone, but he would never confess to having pulled strings with Klaus. </p><p> Nearing eighty, Klaus was a legend in the community, the most daring and successful lefty lawyer south of San Francisco. He only hired the best, and that included Jack McIntyre, Nina's latest crush. Jack was over at the Monterey County Superior Court at a settlement conference. </p><p> Nina called out to the receptionist, "Back in an hour, Astrid. I promise." </p><p> Hurrying down the walk, she caught her sandal on the edge of the stone steps and stopped herself from falling by dropping the mail and raising her arms for balance. She dusted the letters as she picked them up, then tossed them through the car window to the seat, counting to keep track in case one fell between the seat and gearshift. </p><p> Could mean the difference between a future and no future at all, getting every one of those envelopes to the post office. If she was going to be sloppy about details, she might as well slit her throat today and skip the stomachaches and nights of worry altogether, because in the legal profession, as in medicine and architecture, a minor oversight could be lethal. </p><p> Nina had finished college a few years before with a degree in psychology, studying film, art, and people in the luxurious fashion of a girl-child awaiting her prince. She wished now that she'd had better guidance from the adults in her life, who should have known -- what? The future, what real life held for a single mother in her late twenties entering a slow economy? Her psych degree had not even prepared her for service positions in the restaurant business. </p><p> But she was making up for that now, between law classes, paralegal work, and Bob, not in that order. Fog murked its way in front of her. She scrutinized the hazy road for patrol cars, then executed a swooping, illegal U-turn, arriving at the post office in downtown Pacific Grove, heart pounding. She shoved the letters into the metered-mail slot. </p><p> Relieved to be rid of her latest emergency, she fired up the MG along with the radio. Moving out into the street, she narrowly missed a waiting Acura. She swung onto Pine Avenue, drifting toward the middle line as she rummaged in her bag for the address for Dr. Lindberg. She located his card, swerved to avoid a jaywalking tourist family, and turned left onto Highway 1. The pines loomed on either side as the fog drizzled over the Pebble Beach road. She drove swiftly the few blocks to her mother's cottage, parking in front of the huge Norfolk pine in the front yard. </p><p> Honking, she reminded herself about the miserable people she saw every day at work, injured on the job, alone and poor. She conjured these images to steel herself for the sight of her mother carefully locking up, pausing every few steps, looking down as if she weren't sure where the sidewalk was. Her mother had ordered her not to come to the door. She didn't like being reminded of the changes in her health. </p><p> In the one minute she had to herself Nina leaned back and closed her eyes. Breathe deep. In. Out. </p><p> Let's see, Wills and Estates tonight. Professor Cerruti made it her favorite class, but she also liked what lawyers called the "settled" law of that ancient and noble subject. Unlike environmental law, for instance, which fluxed through revolutions every time a new president came in, with Wills one could learn rules that had stuck for centuries. How nice if she could apply a few firm rules to the tatty loose ends of her own life. </p><p> I'll read the cases while I eat dinner, she decided. So much for school. As for work, she had all afternoon to obsess about how much she was falling behind there. Deal with it when she got back to the office. </p><p> As for friends, ha ha, they must think she had moved to Tajikistan, for all they ever heard from her; a boyfriend was not an option, she didn't have time, though she had fallen into some casual overnighters a while back that had left her feeling worse than lonely. But she did feel warm whenever McIntyre came into her office. Her mind began bathing in a certain bubble bath -- but right now here came her mother, struggling down the concrete walk. </p><p> Today, the skin on her mother's face looked tighter than usual. Nina opened the passenger-side door from the inside. Ginny paused to remove her right glove, uncovering a hand scrimshawed in pale blue lines. She leaned in and touched her daughter's hand. "Honey, why not let me take a cab? You're a busy woman." </p><p> "God, Mom. You're like ice." </p><p> Nina's mother had changed so much. Always a handsome woman with sparkling eyes and a daunting energy, she had gradually seemed to lose all color and character. Her skin stretched as tight as a stocking mask over her cheekbones, even pulling her lips back as if they were shrinking. Her once mobile face now looked somehow both flat and puffy, due to both the illness and the steroids used to treat it. Still she tried to smile. </p><p> "You always look so cheerful," Nina said, giving her a brief hug after she had maneuvered into the low-slung car. "How do you do it?" </p><p> "The right attitude makes me feel stronger. You know how much you hate it when people condescend to you, 'Oh, poor Nina, raising a boy on her own, working so hard'?" </p><p> "Oh, come on. I don't pity you." </p><p> "Sure you do. Anyone with half a brain would." Ginny patted her shoulder. "Let's just admire how delightful the leaves are at this time of year, okay?" </p><p> Maybe it had been better, those days of not knowing what was wrong, because of the hope they'd had then. Did her mother still hope? </p><p> Nina drove quickly to Dr. Lindberg's Monterey office on Cass Street. Would she have time later to run by the school library for that book on reserve? She had a mock trial coming up in a week in her Advanced Civil Procedure class and a paper due for Gas and Oil Law that demanded lengthy research. If she hurried, she could pick up Bob at nursery school, drop him with the babysitter at home, stop by the library, and be back at the office by two. Would Remy notice she had been gone longer than her lunch break allowed? </p><p> Gritting her teeth, she thought, Remy would notice. </p><p> She parked at a meter and ran around to the side of the car. "Need help, Mom? Those stairs are pretty steep. Let me help you up them at least." </p><p> Her mother let her help her out of the car, then shook her off. "I rise to all occasions. That will never change. Please don't fuss so much, Nina." </p><p> "If Matt doesn't show up to pick you up, promise me you'll leave a message for me with Astrid. I'll come get you." </p><p> "You're a worrywart." </p><p> Her mother trusted Nina's brother, Matt. Nina hoped she would call if Matt didn't show up. Again. </p><p> </p><p> A few blocks north of Dr. Lindberg's office, Bob attended a preschool chosen after Nina had looked at a dozen of them and settled on this one as the least of all evils. The playroom walls were covered with outsider art Picasso would have envied, committed by three- and four-year-olds who were never given fill-in-the-blanks coloring books. Children were making collages at each table, and she spotted Bob, dark hair fallen over his round, delicious cheeks, smearing a magazine tearout onto gluey paper � la Andr� Breton or Max Ernst. </p><p> Seeing her, he called out, "Mom, look!" Resisting an impulse to check her watch, she pulled up a tiny preschooler plastic chair and sat next to him, nodding at the collage. </p><p> "Finish up, honey, we have to go." Thank God he loved the place and was reluctant to leave. "What's this?" she asked, pointing at a tray of wooden puzzle pieces alongside the collage. </p><p> "My job." He reached over and with startling dexterity stuck the pieces into their slots to complete a duck puzzle. </p><p> "Oh. A duck! Cool!" </p><p> "But now watch this." He dumped the pieces onto the table, then stuck them across the middle in a snaggletooth row. "My keyboard," he said with a grin. "Like at home." </p><p> "But this one you can't play." </p><p> "Huh?" He ran his fingers up and down the wood pieces, humming. He was playing a sea chantey CD at home these days. "'Way haul away, we'll haul away home -- '" </p><p> "But you ruined your puzzle." </p><p> "We can go now." </p><p> Taking her son's backpack and his hand, Nina ushered him to the door. Bob currently loved the cheap battery-operated keyboard she had found at a discount store. He didn't want to learn real songs yet, just loved making noise, but sometimes she caught him fingering the same notes over and over with a thoughtful expression on his face. She would have to find a way to pay for piano lessons when he was older. Never squelch potential talent, Ginny always said. </p><p> As they pulled the door open, an aide handed Nina a paper bag full of dirty pants. "He had two accidents today," she remarked, carefully noncommittal. Nina took the bag. Bob looked up at her with a worried expression. "Mommy, don't break my heart," he said, watching her face. She smiled and patted his hot cheek, hustling him outside, chastising herself for her impatience. </p><p> On the way to the parking lot, she ran into an old friend she hadn't seen for ages. </p><p> "Well, look at you," Diana said. </p><p> Nina hugg...</p></p><h2>O&#39;Keeffe At Abiquiu</h2><p>Georgia O'Keeffe, the most famous woman artist of twentieth-century America, spent the last forty years of her life in quiet isolation in New Mexico, living in an adobe house that she had built on an old property in the village of Abiquiu (pronounced Abbey-cue).<br>Anyone who knows New Mexico, with its fierce light, pungent aroma of sage, and big, open skies, will understand its fascination for O'Keeffe. The landscape is direct and elemental, like her paintings; it is tough and unyielding, like her character.<br>In 1979, some seven years before her death, O'Keeffe permitted Colorado photographer Myron Wood to photograph at Abiquiu and Ghost Ranch. Over the next two-and-a-half years, Wood made hundreds of photographs, of the artist herself, the people closest to her (Juan Hamilton, her manager; gardener Steven Lopez, and others), and most especially of the house, gardens, and surrounding landscape that nourished O'Keeffe so richly.<br>Reproduced here are seventy-nine of Wood's photographs, in subtle tones ranging from stark white to dense black. They do more than merely document the look of the house, they evoke the spirit of the place as O'Keeffe inhabited it. Here are the smooth shapes of the sun-bleached animal bones and river-rounded rocks that the painter loved to collect; here are the hand-rubbed adobe walls of a building that seems to grow out organically from the earth.</p><p></p><h2>Embroidered Treasures: Flowers: Exquisite Needlework of the Embroiderers&#39; Guild Collection</h2><p><b>This fantastic book showcases the Embroiderers' Guild's huge collection of embroidered flowers dating back to the 17th cenury.

She is a mixed media textile artist and is a member of the exhibiting group, Studio 21, a group of textile artists who bring together a creative and innovative mix of media and stitched textilesEmbroidered Treasures: Flowers is a fantastic book! It&#39;s inspirational. It&#39;s informative. It&#39;s beautiful! For most of us who will never see a collection of embroideries like these up close and personal, this lovely book is the best way to experience them and learn about them. We can take what we learn and apply it to our own needlework pursuits. Or we can just enjoy the beauty of the pieces and appreciate the history behind them. It&#39;s a great book for your reference library... and even for your coffee table! * Mary Corbet, www.needlenthread.com * The Embroiderer&#39;s Guild was founded in 1906 by a group of sixteen women who wanted to break away from patterns and kits. Their collection of donated items totals over 6000 and contains many valuable and unique samples of the finest embroidery. This book focuses on floral themes and shows what can be achieved with needle and thread.This is not a book of projects but a book of pictures, suitably large format and hardback. Embroiderers of all levels can gaze at the heights to which their craft can rise to, and anybody who hasn&#39;t taken up this craft can see what all the fuss is about. After a brief introduction to the collection the book is divided into twelve themed sections. These include monochromatic work, metal thread, machine, needlelace, samplers and unusual materials. Each section introduces the theme briefly and then showcases a selection of pieces complete with short descriptions, details of size, date and place it was made and technique. There are samples from as early as the 16th century and cover most types of embroidery including some no longer (or rarely) done. A collar adorned with flowers made from fish scales, Berlin work from the mid 19th century, part of a kimono, evocative samplers stitched by children, a box made from tree bark adorned with embroidery, Victorian beadwork evening bags and an early piece of 16th century blackwork are a few examples. Anybody interested in recycling will love the flowers made from plastic net bags (the sort fruit is sold in), and a machine embroidery picture using tiny scraps of fabric. This is a beautiful book to display on your coffee table and dip into when you want some inspiration. * Dr Annette Collinge * This is a very special book, full of the most beautiful examples of embroidery work through the ages. You will be amazed by the exquisite detail and skill shown in the examples. This most beautiful book and the stunning photographs will be a source of inspiration for generations to come. Highly Recommended! * Hot Brands Cool Places * I&#39;m sure that most people have heard of the Embroiderers&#39; Guild Collection which grew from donations from Guild members, including some from eminent sources - even Queen Mary gave hangings and costumes. The Guild later embarked upon a programme of purchasing carefully selected embroideries and the Permanent Collection now contains over 6,000 pieces. It is currently held by Buckinghamshire County Museum. The book looks at floral inspiration for (mostly traditional) embroideries and the chapters are, in general, based on techniques with such titles as `Embroidery on Evenweave&#39;, `Needlelace&#39; etc. There is a wonderful section on unusual materials which shows work stitched on leather and tree bark as well as some incorporating fish scales and straw. Machine embroidery is included and ranges from wonderful pieces made by trail-blazer Joy Clucas in the 1960s to Richard Box&#39;s innovative work in the 1980s. I&#39;d have like to see a bigger selection here as I know that the Guild has some great machine embroidered artworks. However, it may be that they didn&#39;t fit the theme. In most cases, each item is shown as an entire piece as well as a detail. There is also an excellent index, so useful for students researching a particular technique. * Workshop on the Web *</p><h2>High Steel: The Daring Men Who Built the World&#39;s Greatest Skyline</h2><p><p>With the birth of the steel-frame skyscraper in the late nineteenth century came a new breed of man, as bold and untamed as any this country had ever known. These "cowboys of the skies," as one journalist called them, were the structural ironworkers who walked steel beams -- no wider, often, than the face of a hardcover book -- hundreds of feet above ground, to raise the soaring towers and vaulting bridges that so abruptly transformed America in the twentieth century. </p><p>Many early ironworkers were former sailors, new Americans of Irish and Scandinavian descent accustomed to climbing tall ships' masts and schooled in the arts of rigging. Others came from a small Mohawk Indian reservation on the banks of the St. Lawrence River or from a constellation of seaside towns in Newfoundland. What all had in common were fortitude, courage, and a short life expectancy. "We do not die," went an early ironworkers' motto. "We are killed."</p><p><em>High Steel</em> is the stirring epic of these men and of the icons they built -- and are building still. Shifting between past and present, Jim Rasenberger travels back to the earliest iron bridges and buildings of the nineteenth century; to the triumph of the Brooklyn Bridge and the 1907 tragedy of the Quebec Bridge, where seventy-five ironworkers, including thirty-three Mohawks, lost their lives in an instant; through New York's skyscraper boom of the late 1920s, when ironworkers were hailed as "industrial age heroes." All the while, Rasenberger documents the lives of several contempor-ary ironworkers raising steel on a twenty-first-century skyscraper, the Time Warner building in New York City. </p><p>This is a fast-paced, bare-knuckled portrait of vivid personalities, containing episodes of startling violence (as when ironworkers dynamited the Los Angeles Times building in 1910) and exhilarating adventure. In the end, High Steel is also a moving account of brotherhood and family. Many of those working in the trade today descend from multigenerational dynasties of ironworkers. As they walk steel, they follow in the footsteps of their fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers. </p><p>We've all had the experience of looking at a par-ticularly awe-inspiring bridge or building and wondering, How did they do that? Jim Rasenberger asks -- and answers -- the question behind the question: What sort of person would willingly scale such heights, take such chances, face such danger? The result is a depiction of the American working class as it has seldom appeared in literature: strong, proud, autonomous, enduring, and utterly compelling.</p></p><p><p>Jim Rasenberger is a frequent contributor to the <em>New York Times.</em> He lives in New York City with his wife and twin sons. <em>High Steel</em> is his first book.</p>Inspired by a New York Times article Rasenberger wrote on ironworkers in early 2001, this historical overview of skyscraper construction in New York City and elsewhere traces the erection of such structures as the Flatiron and Chrysler buildings, the Empire State Building, the George Washington Bridge, the World Trade Center and the lavish new Time Warner Center. This last building is the narrative column around which Rasenberger builds his book, which is largely devoted to "the men who risked the most and labored the hardest"&#x2014;the ironworkers who put the high-rise steel columns in place. Though his admiration at times seems compulsory rather than genuine, Rasenberger emphasizes the often heroic, death-defying feats ironworkers perform. He also takes account of far-flung communities that breed ironworkers, such as the Mohawk Indians of upstate New York. The chronological history is broken up by alternating sections on the Time Warner Center and often feels less like a single narrative than a collection of vignettes. Rasenberger's principal claim, that ironwork's days are numbered because of the growing reliance on concrete, is often lost in the telling. Even the Time Warner Center was built more with concrete than iron, which is costlier and more vulnerable to heat in events such as the World Trade Center attacks. This recounting, while less than fully absorbing, serves as a valuable history for building enthusiasts and a thoughtful testament to a dying craft that has helped fuel the American economy for more than a century. 21 b&amp;w photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It was a family which fate drove into the siege of Stalingrad, the Vilna ghetto, occupied Paris, and even into the ranks of the Wehrmacht. His British father was the lucky one, the son of Russian-Jewish emigrants who settled in London after escaping the Bolsheviks, civil war, and revolution. Max, the grandfather, had started out as a socialist and manned the barricades against Tsarist troops, never speaking a word about it afterwards. His wife Frouma came from a family ravaged by the Terror yet making their way in Soviet society despite it all. <br><br>In the centenary of the Russian Revolution, <i>What You Did Not Tell</i> revitalizes the history of a socialism erased from memory--humanistic, impassioned, and broad-ranging in its sympathies. But it is also an exploration of the unexpected happiness that may await history's losers, of the power of friendship and the love of place that made his father at home in an England that no longer exists.</p><p><b>Mark Mazower</b> is a historian specializing in modern Greece, twentieth-century Europe, and international affairs. He is currently the Ira D. Wallach Professor of History at Columbia University. His books include&nbsp;<i>Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews, 1430&#x2013;1950</i>, winner of the Duff Cooper Prize and the Runciman Award;&nbsp;<i>Hitler&#x2019;s Empire: Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe</i>, winner of the&nbsp;<i>LA Times</i>&nbsp;Book Prize for History;&nbsp;<i>Dark Continent:</i>&nbsp;<i>Europe&#x2019;s Twentieth Century</i>; and&nbsp;<i>Governing the World: The History of an Idea</i>, a&nbsp;<i>Financial Times&nbsp;</i>Best Politics Book. His articles and reviews on history and current affairs appear regularly in the&nbsp;<i>Financial Times</i>, the&nbsp;<i>Guardian</i>,&nbsp;the <i>London Review of Books</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Nation</i>, and&nbsp;the<i>&nbsp;New Republic</i>. Born in London and educated at Oxford, he lives in Manhattan.&#x201c;This beautiful book by Mazower, a historian at Columbia University, revolves around his grandfather Max&#x2019;s enigmatic postwar silences. Max had been a brilliant and leading organizer of the Yiddish Bund, a humane form of non-Communist leftism that attracted tens of thousands of adherents in prerevolutionary Russia, Lithuania and Poland. Hunted by czarist police, the Bundists would be crushed not by their enemies but by the far smaller band of jealous, self-interested Bolsheviks, who had other ideas about how to pursue a revolution. An organizer in Vilna and Lodz, Max renounced his activism and settled in a quiet suburb of London. There he raised a family and provided sanctuary for often traumatized emigrants. Soon, however, Mazower&#x2019;s narrative opens out onto an expansive, branching cast of characters that includes family members as well as numerous icons of 20th-century Jewish history (from Emma Goldman to Walter Benjamin). These stories are remarkable, if often devastating. Max&#x2019;s Bundist associate Shmuel Zygielboym persuades the BBC to report on the gassings of Polish Jewry, only to commit suicide in guilt over having left his wife and child behind in the Warsaw Ghetto. Max&#x2019;s long-ago lover is a Menshevik firebrand named Sofia Krylenko, the sister of Lenin&#x2019;s much-feared people&#x2019;s commissar for justice, while the siblings and cousins of Max&#x2019;s deeply adored wife, Frouma, later became ensnared in Stalin&#x2019;s Terror. Mazower&#x2019;s family saga may begin as an effort to recover a way of being Jewish that is often now lost from memory. Yet it is imbued throughout with perceptive asides about what we can learn from &#x201c;history&#x2019;s losers,&#x201d; about solidarity across political divisions and about the tremendous tolls taken by the destabilizing uncertainty of not knowing, under repressive regimes, whether and how loved ones have died. &#x201c;What You Did Not Tell&#x201d; is, in the end, a profound testament to the saving grace of a sense of rootedness in place and home.&#x201d; <b><i>&#x2014;NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Within the experience of a single family can be seen the forces that shaped whole nations and peoples...There comes a moment in every historian&#x2019;s life when his thoughts turn homeward, away from grand clashes and epic struggles.

It is rhapsodic both in the primary sense of the word, in that it is a chronicle exuding a certain air of poetry and exalted, almost epic feeling, and in the more literal sense of being a fabric of words, facts, events and lifelines retrieved from memory and archive and stitched together to form a long-silenced record of a life, an era, a time in human thought and action...a powerful, intimate approach to a momentous slice of history.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;BOOKANISTA</b><i><b><br></b><br></i>&#x201c;Amid a flood of publications that mostly seek to defame and slander the revolution, Mazower&#x2019;s book stands out as one of the few serious and engaging works...it provides a fascinating insight into how the history of the Russian revolutionary movement shaped entire generations and especially a layer of intellectuals who would eventually turn away from any active involvement in the socialist movement. This reviewer hopes that&nbsp;<i>What You Did Not Tell</i>&nbsp;will find many readers and that some of them will be motivated to delve more deeply into the rich and complex history of the Russian revolutionary movement.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;WSWS (WORLD SOCIALIST WEBSITE)</b><i><br><br></i>&#x201c;<i>What You Did Not Tell</i> is a memoir that only one of our finest historians could have written. To call it a &#x201c;memoir&#x201d; even is to represent only a small part of Mazower&#x2019;s investigation into his family&#x2019;s past. This is a saga of cities&#x2014;Vilna, Moscow, Paris, London and New York&#x2014;and a profound meditation on what it takes to call a place home. It spans more than a century and sheds sparkling light on the Bundists, the first mass Marxist party in Russian history. It is history made intimate, history made personal&#x2014;a story of idealism, exile, revolution and defeat. One of the great thrills of <i>What You Did Not Tell</i> is to behold Mazower&#x2019;s deep knowledge of Europe meld with his own ancestral past.&#x201d; <b><b>&#x2014;Michael Greenberg, author of <i>Hurry Down Sunshine</i></b></b><br><br>"The family memoir of a great historian and a subtle writer who is always attentive to humane detail."<b> &#x2014;Orhan Pamuk, recipient of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature<br></b><br>&#x201c;A simultaneously sweeping and intimate family portrait.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;<b><i>KIRKUS REVIEWS<br><br></i></b></b>"It sheds light on the acute political, social, and intellectual dilemmas that confronted European Jews (and others too, but most particularly Jews) in the early 20th century.

Like many other small cities in this vast and ever-evolving country, Fuling is shifting gears and heading down a new path, one of change and vitality, tension and reform, disruption and growth.</p><p>Its position at the crossroads came into sharp focus when Peter Hessler arrived as a Peace Corps volunteer, marking the first time in more than half a century that the city had an American resident. Hessler taught English and American literature at the local college, but it was his students who taught him about the ways of Fuling -- and about the complex process of understanding that takes place when one is immersed in a radically different society. Poignant, thoughtful, funny, and enormously compelling, <i>River Town</i> is an unforgettable portrait of a city that, much like China itself, is seeking to understand both what it was and what it someday will be.</p></p><p>In 1996, 26-year-old Peter Hessler arrived in Fuling, a town on China's Yangtze River, to begin a two-year Peace Corps stint as a teacher at the local college. Along with fellow teacher Adam Meier, the two are the first foreigners to be in this part of the Sichuan province for 50 years. Expecting a calm couple of years, Hessler at first does not realize the social, cultural, and personal implications of being thrust into a such radically different society. In <i>River Town: Two Years on the Yangtze</i>, Hessler tells of his experience with the citizens of Fuling, the political and historical climate, and the feel of the city itself.<p> "Few passengers disembark at Fuling ... and so Fuling appears like a break in a dream--the quiet river, the cabins full of travelers drifting off to sleep, the lights of the city rising from the blackness of the Yangtze," says Hessler. A poor city by Chinese standards, the students at the college are mainly from small villages and are considered very lucky to be continuing their education. As an English teacher, Hessler is delighted with his students' fresh reactions to classic literature. One student says of Hamlet, "I don't admire him and I dislike him. I think he is too sensitive and conservative and selfish." Hessler marvels, </p><blockquote>You couldn't have said something like that at Oxford. You couldn't simply say: I don't like Hamlet because I think he's a lousy person. Everything had to be more clever than that ... you had to dismantle it ... not just the play itself but everything that had ever been written about it.</blockquote> Over the course of two years, Hessler and Meier learn more they ever guessed about the lives, dreams, and expectations of the Fuling people.<p> Hessler's writing is lovely. His observations are evocative, insightful, and often poignant--and just as often, funny. It's a pleasure to read of his (mis)adventures. Hessler returned to the U.S. with a new perspective on modern China and its people.

He has written eleven books and more than one hundred articles, and has taught at a number of universities in Europe, North America, and Mexico. He won the Governor?s Writers Award for Washington State in 1990 for Coming to Our Senses, and was the first recipient of the annual Rollo May Center Grant for Humanistic Studies in 1992. In 2000, The Twilight of American Culture was named a ?Notable Book? by The New York Times Book Review, and in 2013 he received the Neil Postman Award for Career Achievement in Public Intellectual Activity from the Media Ecology Association. Dr. Berman lives in Mexico.The author's call for a life of the body--as opposed to an emphasis on success, material possessions and divisive "isms"--rigorously extends the arguments advanced in his popular The Reenchantment of the World . Stressing that the human infant's emerging self-awareness is bodily as well as conceptual, Berman views conventional birthing methods as traumatic; he faults modern infant care for a dearth of physical contact with the young. His analysis of repressed "somatic awareness" takes unusual turns: a history of mirrors, decoding of upper-class vs. lower-class body language, a review of our changing relations with animals--from reverential cave art to the treatment of other species as mere objects. Next, he identifies a countercultural tradition supposedly rooted in bodily experience and rejecting the cerebral, mechanical way of life of the dominant culture. Examples include Gnostic seers' fusion with godhead, Jewish mysticism, 11th century French Cathar heretics with their trance and ecstasy techniques, the soul travel of Renaissance occultists. This maverick synthesis challenges commonly held assumptions. Photos.

The intention is that the information contained here will be of use to collectors and researchers by explaining how the measuring devices were used and by placing them in a trade and social context. No book of this size could hope to describe in detail every type of measuring device so it is those measuring items likely to be found and collected today that have been included. Some are included because they are regularly encountered; others because they reflect important historical trends or developments. Still others pose intriguing intellectual challenges. Finally, many are simply attractive objects. It is a truism that to measure accurately the measure itself must be finely made and in this can lie great appeal. Special features include illustrated appendixes, a checklist of rule makers and dealers, a full index, and separate index of names.</p><p>Jane and Mark Rees started work on this book ten years ago. Sadly, Mark did not live to see its completion but it is still very much a book written by them both. Jane has worked to complete this since Mark&#39;s passing in 2001. This book is a fitting memorial to him. Jane Rees trained as an architect, concentrating during her working life on the restoration and renovation of historic buildings. She and Mark were founder members of the Tools and Trades History Society and she is now a Vice-President of the Society. She is a historian of technology and trades and is the author of several publications in the field. Together, they were also dealers in the hand tools and artifacts of many trades, most of which are now only a memory. This book is a combination of their academic and commercial expertise and their passion for sharing knowledge.<i>The Rule Book: Measuring for the Trades</i> is an outstanding labor of love dealing with those most diverse and beautiful tools of the craftsman, measures and rules. With extensive text, and copiously illustrated, it deals in detail with both their design and manufacture, and their application to the different trades and crafts, and will be the standard reference on the subject for the foreseeable future. Jane Rees and her late husband Mark are to be congratulated on this new and exceptional addition to the literature of tools and their history. --Phillip Stanley, The Analytical Engine, Worchester, Massachusetts, USA<br><br>This is a fine addition to the limited literature on measuring, and the instruments and tools devised for that task.

She lives near Montreal.</p>PreSchool-Grade 3&#x2013;Scaredy Squirrel is lonely, but he thinks that the pleasure of making a friend would be outweighed by the greater risk of potential danger. After all, there are a lot of things that bite out in the big world beyond his tree trunk such as beavers, bunnies, and, of course, Godzilla. Always thinking, Scaredy decides that the perfect friend (as in perfectly safe, clean, and quiet) would be the goldfish he spots across the park. He carefully outlines everything he will need to do to introduce himself to it, including handing over the Scaredy Risk Test to insure that his new friend is truly not a biter. What the squirrel doesn't plan for is the muddy, rowdy dog he encounters en route. However, he learns that friends come in all sorts of packages and that making an effort can really have rewards. The life lessons of the importance of overcoming one's fears and not judging on outward appearance are wrapped up in a witty package of deceptively simple cartoonlike illustrations that deliver great humor in a variety of lists and diagrams, such as the items Scaredy will need to make the perfect friend, how to outfit himself to make the perfect first impression, and an especially funny Perfect Plan map. The ebullient artwork, clever layout, and lively text make for a surefire hit.&#x2013;<i>Susan Moorhead, New Rochelle Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Or bought a couch at Pottery Barn? Or found some fudge in his mailbox? These are just a few of the mundane happenings Rylant places at the deity's feet. Through everyday events (like showers) to athletics (He falls 20 times while Rollerblading) to more shocking revelations (He gets arrested in a bar fight), God finds out what it is like to live like the rest of us. And guess what? He is just like one of us. He wants juice and comic books when He's sick. And through it all, God is surprised by these revelations. These short poems are visceral in their insight, and they shouldn't be considered blasphemous jokes as much as clever "what if?" ponderings. Has God just been "winging it" His whole life? Rylant has a carefully crafted response. Christian or private schools may find this collection inappropriate to their teachings, but read with an open mind and vivid imagination, it should speak to young people.

For many, that missing ingredient is a true and thorough knowledge of the body's vital points: what they are, where they are, how to quickly find them under duress, how to use them, constructively or for destruction&#x2014;and how to recognize them in the kata, hyung, or forms they thought they knew so well. <br><br>In <i>Pressure Point Fighting</i>, martial arts expert Rick Clark offers a systematic introduction to this knowledge and to the tools needed to ferret out more of this information from forms and techniques already in place&#x2014;knowledge and tools that are not dependent upon acceptance of the tenets of traditional Chinese medicine, or modern Western medicine, for that matter, but which are based solely on open-minded observation and willingness to try new, or old, approaches to martial arts training.</p><p>.<br><br><b>Rick Clark</b> began teaching martial arts in 1962, at the age of fourteen and has been an enthusiastic student ever since. With ample experience in arts including judo, jiujitsu, karate, and Korean systems, a thorough understanding of physiology, and a knack for digging out gems from obscure sources, he has helped to bring about a quiet revolution in the training regimen of martial artists around the world. When he's not traveling throughout North America and Europe to conduct vital-point and applications seminars, he continues to research diligently at home in Indiana.<i>Core Principles</i><p> <i>Do not think always in one straight line<br> - Hozoin School (1600 a.d.)</i></p><p> In this chapter I would like to look at what I consider to be some of the core principles of the martial arts I teach. These core principles can offer you some alternate constructs when analyzing various aspects of the martial arts. In addition, some of these concepts may prove useful in other situations in your life. For example, "out-of-the-box thinking," "fault-tolerant systems," "Ockham's Razor," and "Pareto's 80-20 Law" are concepts found in the business world and philosophy, yet they offer us some insights into the martial arts.</p><p> </p><p>These core principles are not written in stone; they offer some alternate ways of looking at a problem and perhaps a solution not otherwise apparent. Principles can be added to this list at any time, and you may have some principles you feel should be added to this short list. As I become aware of other concepts that offer insight into my teaching and training, I will gladly add them to my core principles. We should always endeavor to increase the body of knowledge and our understanding of the martial arts. I have often found it interesting to discover principles in the strangest places; you could be reading a book on philosophy or business and find a principle that relates to the martial arts. Read and expand your knowledge, not only in the area of martial arts but in other areas as well. </p><p></p><p>The following concepts are touched on briefly, but entire chapters and books could be written on any one of these concepts. This is beyond the scope of this text and my limits as well.

Instead, she wants to be a great warrior maiden--a female knight. But in the land of Tortall, women aren't allowed to train as warriors. So Alanna finds a way to switch places with her twin, Thom, and take his place as a knight in training at the palace of King Roald. Disguising herself as a boy, Alanna begins her training as a page in the royal court. Soon, she is garnering the admiration of all around her, including the crown prince, with her strong work ethic and her thirst for knowledge. But all the while, she is haunted by the recurring vision of a black stone city that emanates evil... somehow she knows it is her fate to purge that place of its wickedness. But how will she find it? And can she fulfill her destiny while keeping her gender a secret? <p> With <i>Alanna: The First Adventure</i>, veteran fantasy author Tamora Pierce has created a lively, engaging heroine who will charm middle-school readers with her tomboyish bravado and have them eagerly searching for the next book in the Song of the Lioness series. Like Brian Jacques's tales of Redwall, this popular quartet is an entertaining fantasy series for younger teens.

The three syllables of this name, unusual in 1920s Japan, captivate a 28-year-old engineer, who soon becomes infatuated with the girl so named, a teenaged cafe waitress. Drawn to her Eurasian features and innocent demeanor, Joji is eager to whisk young Naomi away from the seamy underbelly of post--World War I Tokyo and to mold her into his ideal wife. But when the two come together to indulge their shared passion for Western culture, Joji discovers that Naomi is far from being the naive girl of his fantasies, and his passion descends into a comically helpless masochism. <br>A literary masterpiece that helped to establish Junichiro Tanizaki as Japan's greatest novelist, Naomi" is both a hilarious story of one man's obsession and torment, and a brilliant evocation of a nation's cultural confusion."Hilarious....

The three surviving contenders for the throne of the Seven Kingdoms continue to struggle among themselves, Robb Stark defends his kingdom from the Greyjoys, Jon Snow confronts an escalating threat, and Danerys Stormborn and her dragon allies continue to grow in power.</p><p>Is George R.R. Martin for real? Can a fantasy epic actually get <i>better</i> with each new installment? Fans of the genre have glumly come to expect go-nowhere sequels from other authors, so we're entitled to pinch ourselves over Martin's tightly crafted Song of Ice and Fire series. The reports are all true: this series is the real deal, and Martin deserves his crown as the rightful king of the epic. <i>A Game of Thrones</i> got things off to a rock-solid start, <i>A Clash of Kings</i> only exceeded expectations, but it's the <i>Storm of Swords</i> hat trick that cements Martin's rep as the most praiseworthy fantasy author to come along since that other R.R.<p> Like the first two books, <i>A Storm of Swords</i> could coast on the fundamentals: deftly detailed characters, convincing voices and dialogue, a robust back-story, and a satisfyingly unpredictable plot. But it's Martin's consistently bold choices that set the series apart. Every character is fair game for the headman's axe (sometimes literally), and not only do the good guys regularly lose out to the bad guys, you're never exactly sure who you should be cheering for in the first place.</p><p> <i>Storm</i> is full of admirable intricacies. Events that you thought Martin was setting up solidly for the first two books are exposed as complex feints; the field quickly narrows after the Battle of the Blackwater and once again, anything goes. Robb tries desperately to hold the North together, Jon returns from the wildling lands with a torn heart, Bran continues his quest for the three-eyed crow beyond the Wall, Catelyn struggles to save her fragile family, Arya becomes ever more wolflike in her wanderings, Daenerys comes into her own, and Joffrey's cruel rule from King's Landing continues, making even his fellow Lannisters uneasy. Martin tests all the major characters in <i>A Storm of Swords</i>: some fail the trial, while others--like Martin himself--seem to only get stronger. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p><br>Here is the third volume in George R. R. Martin's magnificent cycle of novels that includes A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings. As a whole, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Magic, mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill these pages and transport us to a world unlike any we have ever experienced. Already hailed as a classic, George R. R. Martin's stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction. <br>A Storm of Swords <br>Of the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King's Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world.... <br>But as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings arrives from the outermost line of civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others--a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. As the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in averitable storm of swords. . .</p><h2>Operation Chowhound: The Most Risky, Most Glorious US Bomber Mission of WWII</h2><p><p><b>The true story of a little-known, yet remarkable World War II operation, which had all the hallmarks of a suicide mission.</b></p><p>Beginning with a crazy plan hatched by a suspect prince, and an even crazier reliance on the word of the Nazis, Operation Chowhound was devised. Between May 1 and May 8, 1945, 2,268 military units flown by the USAAF, dropped food to 3.5 million starving Dutch civilians in German-occupied Holland. </p><p>It took raw courage to fly on Operation Chowhound, as American aircrews never knew when the German AAA might open fire on them or if Luftwaffe fighters might jump them. Flying at 400 feet, barely above the tree tops, with guns pointed directly at them, they would have no chance to bail out if their B-17s were hit&#x2015;and yet, over eight days, 120,000 German troops kept their word, and never fired on the American bombers. As they flew, grateful Dutch civilians spelled out "Thanks Boys" in the tulip fields below. Many Americans who flew in Operation Chowhound would claim it was the best thing they did in the war. </p><p>In this gripping narrative, author Stephen Dando-Collins takes the reader into the rooms where Operation Chowhound was born, into the aircraft flying the mission, and onto the ground in the Netherlands with the civilians who so desperately needed help. James Bond creator Ian Fleming, Hollywood actress Audrey Hepburn, as well as Roosevelt, Eisenhower, and Churchill all play a part in this story, creating a compelling, narrative read.</p></p><p><p><b>Stephen Dando-Collins </b>is an award-winning military historian with numerous highly praised books on ancient history ranging from Imperial Rome to the American west to Australia, some of which include <i>Legions of Rome</i> and <i>Caesar's Legion</i>.

His narrative deftly places the reader beside the planners and the air crews behind the missions as well as the Dutch recipients of the food drops and the German occupiers who sanctioned the operation. Well-researched and clearly-written, this book explains why Chowhound was such a heroic precedent for the famed Berlin Airlift of several years later.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Phil Samponaro, Associate Professor of History, University of Texas at Brownsville</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Operation Chowhound</i> reveals one of the most neglected operations of World War II, the massive air campaign to feed the starving Dutch in the dwindling days of the conflict. In the last weeks of the war American and British B-17s, B-24s and Avro Lancasters dropped tons of food parcels at strategic points in Nazi occupied Holland where the Dutch population had been near starvation for months. A touchy ceasefire held between the allies and Germans and thousands of Dutch citizens were saved.

This spy network included an ex-Cartier jewel salesman and wine merchant, a madcap Harvard anthropologist, a Parisian playboy who ran with Hemingway, ex-French Foreign Legionnaires and Paris bankers, and a WWI hero.

Their objective? To prepare the groundwork for what eventually became Operation TORCH - the Anglo-American invasion of North Africa that repelled the Nazis and also enabled the liberation of Italy.The twelve Americans included an ex-Cartier jewel salesman and wine merchant from a patrician family; a madcap Harvard anthropologist; a Coca-Cola salesman and Paris playboy who ran with Ernest Hemingway and the Lost Generation crowd; a rather Elizabethan adventurer-cum-interpreter; a construction expert; a distinguished lawyer; some American ex-French Foreign Legionnaires and Paris bankers; and an Annapolis graduate and hero of WWI. These vice consuls were soon caught up in a web of espionage and treachery that included double-dealing mistresses, Gaullist and Vichy agents, and a homicidal French monk.Based on recently declassified foreign records, as well as the memoirs of Ridgeway Brewster Knight (one of the twelve &#x201c;apostles&#x201d;), FDR'S 12 Apostles is a fascinating account of international intrigue.Set in exotic locales from Paris to Casablanca to Tangier, the story takes us through the pivotal TORCH invasion and the eventual assassination of Vichy French leader Francois Darlan.

In <i>An Imaginary Tale</i>, Paul Nahin tells the 2000-year-old history of one of mathematics' most elusive numbers, the square root of minus one, also known as <i>i</i>. He recreates the baffling mathematical problems that conjured it up, and the colorful characters who tried to solve them.</p><p>In 1878, when two brothers stole a mathematical papyrus from the ancient Egyptian burial site in the Valley of Kings, they led scholars to the earliest known occurrence of the square root of a negative number. The papyrus offered a specific numerical example of how to calculate the volume of a truncated square pyramid, which implied the need for <i>i</i>. In the first century, the mathematician-engineer Heron of Alexandria encountered <i>I </i>in a separate project, but fudged the arithmetic; medieval mathematicians stumbled upon the concept while grappling with the meaning of negative numbers, but dismissed their square roots as nonsense. By the time of Descartes, a theoretical use for these elusive square roots--now called "imaginary numbers"--was suspected, but efforts to solve them led to intense, bitter debates. The notorious <i>i</i> finally won acceptance and was put to use in complex analysis and theoretical physics in Napoleonic times.</p><p>Addressing readers with both a general and scholarly interest in mathematics, Nahin weaves into this narrative entertaining historical facts and mathematical discussions, including the application of complex numbers and functions to important problems, such as Kepler's laws of planetary motion and ac electrical circuits. This book can be read as an engaging history, almost a biography, of one of the most evasive and pervasive "numbers" in all of mathematics.</p></p><p>At the very beginning of his book on <i>i</i>, the square root of minus one, Paul Nahin warns his readers: "<i>An Imaginary Tale</i> has a very strong historical component to it, but that does not mean it is a mathematical lightweight. But don't read too much into that either. It is *not* a scholarly tome meant to be read only by some mythical, elite group.... Large chunks of this book can, in fact, be read and understood by a high school senior who has paid attention to his or her teachers in the standard fare of pre-college courses. Still, it will be most accessible to the million or so who each year complete a college course in freshman calculus.... But when I need to do an integral, let me assure you I have not fallen to my knees in dumbstruck horror. And neither should you."<p> Nahin is a professor of electrical engineering at the University of New Hampshire; he has also written a number of science fiction short stories. His style is far more lively and humane than a mathematics textbook while covering much of the same ground. Readers will end up with a good sense for the mathematics of <i>i</i> and for its applications in physics and engineering. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p><p>"Dispelling many common myths about the origin of the mystic 'imaginary' unit, Nahin tells the story of<i>i</i> from a historic as well as human perspective. His enthusiasm and informal style easily catch on to the reader.<i>An Imaginary Tale</i> is a must for anyone curious about the evolution of our number concept."<b>--Eli Maor, author of<i>Trigonometric Delights</i>, <i>e: The Story of a Number</i>, and <i>To Infinity and Beyond</i></b></p></p><h2>Sampler Motifs and Symbolism</h2><p>A dictionary of the symbolic meanings behind old sampler motifs and the reproduction of a Scottish sampler, plus four new traditional samplers with complete graphs and instructions for each.</p><p></p><h2>Tommy: The British Soldier on the Western Front</h2><p><p>The first history of World War I to place centre-stage the British soldier who fought in the trenches, this superb and important book tells the story of an epic and terrible war through the letters, diaries and memories of those who fought it.</p><p>Of the six million men who served in the British army, nearly one million lost their lives and over two million were wounded.

Each of the simple but pithy poems is set in a different locale and focuses on children's chores and pastimes. Youngsters are depicted doing typical activities of the day, such as stitching samplers, carding wool, collecting maple sap, and playing marbles. The upcoming revolution is not mentioned until the last two lines (The colonial year is fast away./And tomorrow is an American day), but suggestions of what is to come are cleverly woven into the illustrations. For example, the entry for July features a woman in a red-and-white striped dress reading a newspaper with the headline Unite or Die standing next to a child wearing a white bonnet with blue stars. The historically accurate pen-and-ink and watercolor pictures have been carefully composed. They have a folk-art quality and feature calico prints on almost every surface, including fields, apple trees, and the flames in a fireplace, as well as the different colonies on the appended map. This book is a treat for the eye and an excellent introduction to this period in American history.<i>&#x2013;Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Noticing that there are some in the snow-covered village who have needs that she can satisfy, she unravels a bit of wool from the blanket and knits, then secretly delivers warm socks for young Nikolai, who has a hole in his shoe; an extra-long scarf for the postman; and cozy mittens for the schoolmaster to wear when he fetches wood.

Tintin is a Belgian amateur detective who gets embroiled in every kind of thriller-adventure, along with his dog Snowy, the two policemen Thomson and Thompson, Captain Haddock and Professor Cuthbert Calculus.</p><p>Volume 4 of the 3-in-1 Tintin series begins in the middle of an adventure, concluding the story begun in <i>The Secret of the Unicorn</i>. (Keeping all the two-part stories together was not possible in the 3-in-1 format because chronologically, the <i>Unicorn</i>/<i>Rackham</i> and <i>Crystal</i>/<i>Prisoners</i> two-parters are back to back.) <i>Red Rackham's Treasure</i> follows Tintin and friends as they search for the pirate booty procured by Captain Haddock's ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock, in the West Indies. They receive some unexpected help in the form of a hard-of-hearing inventor named Professor Calculus, who would go on to become one of the most endearing characters of the series. (Herge admitted that the character was one "whom I never suspected would take on such importance.") It's a lot of fun, with some submarine and diving adventures, humor from the Thompsons, and an unexpected (but satisfying) ending. <i>The Seven Crystal Balls</i> begins on a light note, as Captain Haddock tries to adjust to his new life as a gentleman following the events of <i>Red Rackham's Treasure</i>. He wears a monocle and frequents the music hall, where in a not-unusual coincidence he and Tintin happen to find General Alcazar (<i>The Broken Ear</i>) and the dreaded diva Bianca Castafiore. However, it's the act of fakir Ragdalam with Madame Yamilah, the amazing clairvoyante, that reveals the central adventure: the scientists excavating the tomb of Racar Capac have incurred the curse of the Inca. Despite the efforts of bungling detectives Thompson ("With a P, as in Philadelphia") and Thomson ("Without a P, as in Venezuela"), the explorers are stricken, and one of Tintin's closest friends disappears mysteriously, leading to a trip to Peru in the second part, <i>Prisoners of the Sun</i>. <i>After The Seven Crystal Balls</i> set the eerie stage, Tintin and his friends continue their adventures in Peru. There Tintin rescues an orange-seller named Zorrino from being bullied, and the young man becomes their guide in their quest to find the Temple of the Sun. But they find more than they bargained for and end up in a hot spot. The perils of this engaging two-part adventure are especially harrowing in their combination of the supernatural and the real, although the resolution is a little too deus ex machina. Calculus and the Thompsons provide their usual comic relief.<p> The 3-in-1 format provides excellent value, but the small size (about 40% smaller than the single-story paperbacks) makes it harder to enjoy the detail in Herge's layouts. <i>--David Horiuchi</i></p>Herg�, one of the most famous Belgians in the world, was a comics writer and artist. The internationally successful Adventures of Tintin are his most well-known and beloved works. They have been translated into 38 different languages and have inspired such legends as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. He wrote and illustrated for The Adventures of Tintin until his death in 1983.</p><h2>Between Past and Future: Eight Exercises in Political Thought</h2><p>Arendt&#39;s penetrating observations of the modern world, based on a profound knowledge of the past, constitute a major contribution to political philosophy.

"Sometimes I turn the ringer off. Sometimes I ignore the ringing. Sometimes I pick up the phone with suspicion. Sometimes I get impatient with the interruption." The irony, of course, is that "unlike a lot of other calls, the one from Spirit is the one we are hoping to receive." Baldwin (<i>Life's Companion</i>) excels in helping readers converse with the divine. Here, she devotes a chapter to each of the "Seven Whispers of spiritual commonsense": <blockquote> 1) Maintain peace of mind ("the cornerstone of a spiritual life")<br> 2) Move at the pace of guidance ("rehumanize our speed of life")<br> 3) Practice certainty of purpose ("a commitment to figuring out why we are here and what we are going to do about it")<br> 4) Surrender to surprise (this helps us "practice the resilience we need to respond to whatever life offers")<br> 5) Ask for what you need and offer what you can ("become spiritual traders of life's energy, time and abundance")<br> 6) Love the folks in front of you ("look for the good in people even if we don't think it's there")<br> 7) Return to the world (remove yourself from the simulated world and "return to the world of the body, the senses, the world of Nature") </blockquote> <p>This is a compact book, packed with a wise woman's spiritual homilies. While no one can make Spirit phone home more often, <i>Seven Whispers</i> will certainly eliminate the static and make for a better connection. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Self-exploration pioneer Christina Baldwin (Life's Companion; Calling the Circle) urges readers to connect with the spiritual world in The Seven Whispers: Listening to the Voice of the Spirit. Baldwin shares her own personal daily meditation, which consists of seven phrases maintain peace of mind, move at the pace of guidance, practice certainty of purpose, surrender to surprises, ask for what you need and offer what you can, love the folks in front of you, return to the world that she explains in the seven chapters of this volume, showing readers how to attain these attitudes by listening to their inner voice. <p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Constitution of the United States of America with the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation</h2><p>Hardcover copy of the US Constitution, Declaration of Independence and Articles of Confederation.

Well, once. But that was a mistake. I'll tell you about it later. The thing is, I got off on it. I really enjoyed it.<br> It's like when you hear serial killers say they feel no regret, no remorse for all the people they killed. I was like that. Loved it. I didn't care how long it took either, because I was in no hurry. I'd wait until they were totally in love with me. Till the big saucer eyes were looking at me. I loved the shock on their faces. Then the glaze as they tried to hide how much I was hurting them. And it was legal. I think I<br> killed a few of them. Their souls, I mean. It was their souls I was after. I know I came close a couple of times. But don't worry, I got my comeuppance. That's why I'm telling you this. Justice was done. Balance has been restored. The same thing happened to me, only worse. Worse because it happened to me. I feel purged now, you see. Cleansed. I've been punished, so it's okay to talk about it all. At least that's how it seems to me. I carried the guilt of my crimes around with me for years after I stopped drinking. I couldn't even look at a girl, much less believe I deserved to converse with one. Or maybe I was just afraid that they'd see through me. Either way, after getting into Alcoholics Anonymous, I didn't even kiss a girl for five years. Seriously. Not so much as holding hands.<br> I meant business.<br> I think I always knew deep down I had a drinking problem. I just never got around to admitting it. I drank purely for effect. But then, as far as I was concerned, wasn't everyone doing the same thing? I started to realize something was wrong when I began to get beaten up. My mouth always got me into trouble, of course. I'd go up to the biggest guy in the place and look up his nostrils and call him a faggot. And then when he'd head-butt me, I'd say, "Call that a headbutt?" So the guy would do it again harder. The second time I'd have less to say. One of my "victims" stuck my head on an electric cooker ring. In Limerick. Stab City. I was lucky to get out of that house alive. He'd done it, though, because I'd been taking the pith out of hiths listhp. Maybe that's why I moved on to girls. More sophisticated, doncha know. And girls wouldn't beat me up. They'd just stare at me in disbelief and shock.<br> Their eyes, you see.<br> All the pretense and rules dissolved away. There was just the two of us and the pain. All those intimate moments, every little sigh, those gentle touches, the lovemaking, the confidences, the orgasms, the attempted orgasms-all mere fuel. The deeper in they were, the more beautiful they looked when the moment came.<br> And I lived for the moment. I was working freelance in advertising all through this period in London. As an art director. A contradiction in terms if ever there was one. It's what I still do today. Strangely, I<br> was always able to get money. Even in art school, I got a grant because my dad had just retired and I suddenly became eligible. And after that I got job after job without too much trouble.<br> I never looked like a drunk, I just was one, and anyway in those days advertising was a far more boozy affair than it is today. Because I was freelance, I could be my own man, so to speak, and I would keep myself busy by ensuring I had dates lined up. None of the girls were supposed to know this. The idea was to have an impressive queue so that when one girl neared maturity-usually after about three or four dates with some phone calls in between-another would be introduced. Then as one went onto the scrap heap, a new one would take her place. Nothing unusual about my method, everyone did it. But I enjoyed it so much. Not the sex or even the conquest, but the causing of pain.<br> It was after my crazy night with Pen (more on that in a minute) that I realized I had found my niche in life. Somehow I was able to lure these creatures into my lair. Half the time I was trying to push them away, but it had just the opposite effect. And the fact that they were attracted to a piece of shit like me made me hate them even more than if<br> they'd laughed in my face and walked away. As for looks? I'm nothing special, but I'm told I have beautiful eyes. Eyes from which nothing but truth could possibly seep.<br> They say the sea is actually black and that it merely reflects the blue sky above. So it was with me. I allowed you to admire yourself in my eyes. I provided a service. I listened<br> and listened and listened. You stored yourself in me.<br> Nothing had ever felt so right to me. If I'm honest, even today I miss hurting. I'm not cured of it, but I don't set out to systematically dismantle like I used to. I don't miss the booze half as much. Oh, to hurt again. Since those heady days I heard an adage that seems to apply here: "Hurt people hurt people."<br> I see now that I was in pain and wanted others to feel it, too. This was my way of communicating. I'd meet the women the first night and get the obligatory phone number and then after another couple of days, making them sweat a little, I'd call and be all nervous. They loved that. I'd ask them out and pretend I hardly ever did "this kind of thing" and say that I hadn't been out a lot in London because I didn't really know the scene. This was true, though, because all I used to do was get out of my head in local bars around Camberwell.<br> We'd agree to meet somewhere. I liked Greenwich, with the river and the boats and of course the pubs. And it had a great boyfriend/girlfriend feel. Nice and respectable. I'd be half out of it before we even met, but I'd be witty and charming and boyish and shaking. Trying to put me at ease, they'd smile and comment on my trembling, thinking I was nervous to create a good impression. Because I wasn't getting in enough booze, my very being would shudder. I'd have to order two large Jamesons at the counter for her every half lager. I'd down the Jimmys without her seeing and then on with the show.<br> Lovely.<br> I didn't really care if I got them into bed or not. I just wanted some company while I got pissed, while I waited for the courage to hurt to well up in me. And they seemed pleased because I wasn't trying to grope them. Sometimes I would. But mostly I'd be fairly well behaved. This would go on for a few dates. In the meantime I would encourage them to tell me about themselves.<br> This is very important for the successful moment later. The more they confided and invested in you, the deeper the shock and the more satisfying the moment at the end. So, I'd be told of their dog's habits, their teddy bear's names, their father's moods, their mother's fears. Did I like kids? How many brothers and sisters did I have? A sitcom I had to sit through. But it was okay, because I knew I'd be writing her out of the series.<br> She'd talk and talk and talk, and I'd nod. Raise a strategic eyebrow. Grimace when necessary. Guffaw or feign shock, whatever was required. I'd watch people in conversation and record their facial expressions. Interest: Raise one eyebrow and raise or lower the other depending on the conversation.<br> Attraction: Try to blush. Not easy, this (thoughts of what I was going to do to her later helped). And a blush usually begot a blush. That is, if I could muster a blush, she was more than likely to blush back. Sympathy: Crinkle the forehead and nod gently. Charmed: Cock your head to one side and smile apologetically. I'd supply these prefab masks on cue. It was easy. It was enjoyable. Guys did it all the time to get laid. I did it to get even. Unkind to Womankind. That was my mission. Around this time I discovered the meaning of the word "misogynist." I remember thinking it hilarious that it had "Miss" as a prefix.<br> All I know is, I felt better when I saw someone else in pain. But of course they would often hide how much I had hurt them. Yes, it was a challenge in itself to help her externalize her feelings, but also bloody frustrating to have gone to all that trouble and then not be able to enjoy a dramatic playback. That's why it became necessary to condense everything into the one demonstrative moment.<br> Sophie was from South London. She used to do the wardrobe for Angus Brady on the comedy show Aren't You Glad to See Me? I met her at a Camberwell College of Arts party that I had crashed. After her, there was that designer girl-whose name I honestly can't remember-who I'm sure I hurt very deeply because she never called me back. Funny that, because even though I never met her again or even heard her say another word, I knew she had it bad.<br> How do I know?<br> I know.<br> There was Jenny. She was the one who threw the beer in my face. I was thrilled to have had a hand in causing so much rage.<br> Then came Emily. But she doesn't really count because she was as good if not better at whatever this is than I was. I kind of fell for her. Laura was somewhere in there. An ex- band publicist with a superb arse that had survived a young daughter. I woke up one morning and there was an eight-year-old girl watching as I tried to extricate myself from the freckled tentacles of her comatose mother. And then after she guilted me into walking her to school, I got the feeling that mother and daughter made full use of the men that passed through their lives. Like the Native American and the Buffalo, The Eskimo and the Seal, The Welfare Mother and Me.<br> And the one who started it all.<br> Penelope Arlington. I'd been going out with her for four and a half years. Long time. She'd been nice to me. Nicer to me than any other girl had ever been. When I spoke, she turned her head toward me and seemed to abandon herself to the meaning of my words. I liked that. It was only much later that I found out she was terrible in bed. At the time I thought she was wanton. She wasn't. But she's the one I regret hurting the most. Why? Because she didn't deserve it. Not that the others did, but she wouldn't have left me if I hadn't ripped her apart. And I needed her to leave me because she was getting in the way of my drinking.<br> And one night I just cracked up. It'd been bubbling for ages. Simmer, simmer, bubble, stew . . . gurgle. I got completely fizzingly drunk and this whole chain of events began to rattle. Why would anyone set out to break the heart of someone he loved? Why would anyone intentionally cause that kind of pain?<br> Why did people kill each other?<br> Because they enjoyed it. Was it really that simple? To achieve a soul-shattering, it is better if the perpetrator has been through the same experience. Hurt people hurt people more skillfully. An expert heartbreaker knows the effect of each incision. The blade slips in barely noticed, the pain and the apology delivered at the same time.</p><h2>Selected Climbs in the Cascades</h2><p><br><br>For ambitious newbies and hardcore climbers alike, this revised guide includes 12 new climbs in the Cascades.<br>* Details more than 75 of the most popular climbs in the Cascades<br><br>* 200 black and white photographs, half with route overlays<br><br>* Thirty maps<br>Fun and challenging, this edition contains a mix of walk-ups, snow climbs, scrambles, wilderness alpine routes, hard rock climbs, ice climbs, and strenuous mixed climbs.

More specifically, he shows how Jesus&#39; life, death, and resurrection transformed life&#39;s meaning, and how this Christ-meaning should transform a Christian&#39;s experience of life. Cooke proposes that mutual concern and support for one another are the substance of Christian sacraments. He situates friendship as the most basic sacrament of God&#39;s saving presence in human life, and shows that sacrament liturgies celebrate initiation into the deepest and most fundamental of all human experiences. This revised and updated edition contains new material on the Eucharist, as well as historical and theological updates on core material.

It's a humorous story about a mad scientist who happens to be a misogynist (a person who hates women). <br> <br> In this tale, the evil scientist, Dr. Frankenbeanies, wants to create a monster. He decides to make it a 'lady monster' so he can 'boss it around'. From there, his vile and ignorant ideas get more and more outrageous.<br> <br> I wanted to show kids how BAD and STUPID it is to discriminate, so I made sure that the mad scientist was as unlikable as possible. His hateful agenda is so backwards, even his naive assistant points it out to him. True to his character, however, the mad scientist's pig-headedness continues until he is finally punished by the very woman he intended to discriminate against.<br> <br> His punishment is deliberately funny, too. I wanted this despicable character to be SO unsympathetic that my audience wouldn't even feel sorry for him when he gets his 'just reward'.<br> <br> I have a feeling that some children will read this comic and won't even realize that it has a feminist agenda. But I doubt that any child, not even a two-year-old, would mistake the mad scientist for a 'good guy'. Even if children simply laugh at the story and come away with an idea that it's bad to be mean, then I feel like I accomplished what I set out to do. <br> <br> Kids learn by examples--- both good and bad examples.<br> <br> And who knows? Perhaps this silly story will plant a seed: that being a hateful person will make you look evil and foolish, and nobody will care if bad things happen to you."<b> </b></i><strong>--Dav Pilkey<br> <br> <br> Fun Facts:<br> <br> 1.

About that roofless court stood four high walls of stone. Behind those were rooms and courts, passages, corridors, towers, and at last the heavy outmost walls of the Great House of Roke, which would stand any assault of war or earthquake or the sea itself, being built not only of stone, but of incontestable magic. For Roke is the Isle of the Wise, where the Art Magic is taught; and the Great House is the school and central place of wizardry; and the central place of the House is that small court far within the walls, where the fountain plays and the trees stand in rain or sun or starlight.<br> <br>The tree nearest the fountain, a well-grown rowan, had humped and cracked the marble pavement with its roots. Veins of bright green moss filled the cracks, spreading up from the grassy plot around the basin. A boy sat there on the low hump of marble and moss, his gaze following the fall of the fountain&#x2019;s central jet. He was nearly a man, but still a boy; slender, dressed richly. His face might have been cast in golden bronze, it was so finely molded and so still.<br> <br>Behind him, fifteen feet away perhaps, under the trees at the other end of the small central lawn, a man stood, or seemed to stand. It was hard to be certain in that flickering shift of shadow and warm light. Surely he was there, a man in white, standing motionless. As the boy watched the fountain, the man watched the boy. There was no sound or movement but the play of leaves and the play of the water and its continual song.<br> <br>The man walked forward. A wind stirred the rowan tree and moved its newly opened leaves. The boy leapt to his feet, lithe and startled. He faced the man and bowed to him. &#x201c;My Lord Archmage,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>The man stopped before him, a short, straight, vigorous figure in a hooded cloak of white wool. Above the folds of the laid-down hood his face was reddish-dark, hawk-nosed, seamed on one cheek with old scars. The eyes were bright and fierce. Yet he spoke gently. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a pleasant place to sit, the Court of the Fountain,&#x201d; he said, and, forestalling the boy&#x2019;s apology, &#x201c;You have traveled far and have not rested. Sit down again.&#x201d;<br> <br>He knelt on the white rim of the basin and held out his hand to the ring of glittering drops that fell from the higher bowl of the fountain, letting the water run through his fingers. The boy sat down again on the humped tiles, and for a minute neither spoke.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are the son of the Prince of Enlad and the Enlades,&#x201d; the Archmage said, &#x201c;heir of the Principality of Morred. There is no older heritage in all Earthsea, and none fairer. I have seen the orchards of Enlad in the spring, and the golden roofs of Berila.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How are you called?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am called Arren.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That would be a word in the dialect of your land. What is it in our common speech?&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy said, &#x201c;Sword.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Archmage nodded. There was silence again, and then the boy said, not boldly, but without timidity, &#x201c;I had thought the Archmage knew all languages.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man shook his head, watching the fountain.<br> <br>&#x201c;And all names.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All names? Only Segoy who spoke the First Word, raising up the isles from the deep sea, knew all names. To be sure,&#x201d; and the bright, fierce gaze was on Arren&#x2019;s face, &#x201c;if I needed to know your true name, I would know it. But there&#x2019;s no need. Arren I will call you; and I am Sparrowhawk. Tell me, how was your voyage here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Too long.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The winds blew ill?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The winds blew fair, but the news I bear is ill, Lord Sparrowhawk.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell it, then,&#x201d; the Archmage said gravely, but like one yielding to a child&#x2019;s impatience; and while Arren spoke, he looked again at the crystal curtain of water drops falling from the upper basin into the lower, not as if he did not listen, but as if he listened to more than the boy&#x2019;s words.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know, my lord, that the prince my father is a wizardly man, being of the lineage of Morred, and having spent a year here on Roke in his youth. Some power he has and knowledge, though he seldom uses his arts, being concerned with the ruling and ordering of his realm, the governance of cities and matters of trade. The fleets of our island go out westward, even into the West Reach, trading for sapphires and ox hides and tin, and early this winter a sea captain returned to our city Berila with a tale that came to my father&#x2019;s ears, so that he had the man sent for and heard him tell it.&#x201d; The boy spoke quickly, with assurance. He had been trained by civil, courtly people, and did not have the self-consciousness of the young.<br> <br>&#x201c;The sea captain said that on the isle of Narveduen, which is some five hundred miles west of us by the ship lanes, there was no more magic. Spells had no power there, he said, and the words of wizardry were forgotten. My father asked him if it was that all the sorcerers and witches had left that isle, and he answered, &#x2018;No: there were some there who had been sorcerers, but they cast no more spells, not even so much as a charm for kettle-mending or the finding of a lost needle.&#x2019; And my father asked, &#x2018;Were not the folk of Narveduen dismayed?&#x2019; And the sea captain said again, &#x2018;No, they seemed uncaring.&#x2019; And indeed, he said, there was sickness among them, and their autumn harvest had been poor, and still they seemed careless. He said&#x2014;I was there, when he spoke to the prince&#x2014;he said, &#x2018;They were like sick men, like a man who has been told he must die within the year, and tells himself it is not true, and he will live forever. They go about,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;without looking at the world.&#x2019; When other traders returned, they repeated the tale that Narveduen had become a poor land and had lost the arts of wizardry. But all this was mere tales of the Reach, which are always strange, and only my father gave it much thought.<br> <br>&#x201c;Then in the New Year, in the Festival of the Lambs that we hold in Enlad, when the shepherds&#x2019; wives come into the city bringing the firstlings of the flocks, my father named the wizard Root to say the spells of increase over the lambs. But Root came back to our hall distressed and laid his staff down and said, &#x2018;My lord, I cannot say the spells.&#x2019; My father questioned him, but he could say only, &#x2018;I have forgotten the words and the patterning.&#x2019; So my father went to the marketplace and said the spells himself, and the festival was completed. But I saw him come home to the palace that evening, and he looked grim and weary, and he said to me, &#x2018;I said the words, but I do not know if they had meaning.&#x2019; And indeed there&#x2019;s trouble among the flocks this spring, the ewes dying in birth, and many lambs born dead, and some are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. deformed.&#x201d; The boy&#x2019;s easy, eager voice dropped; he winced as he said the word and swallowed. &#x201c;I saw some of them,&#x201d; he said. There was a pause.<br> <br>&#x201c;My father believes that this matter, and the tale of Narveduen, show some evil at work in our part of the world. He desires the counsel of the Wise.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That he sent you proves that his desire is urgent,&#x201d; said the Archmage. &#x201c;You are his only son, and the voyage from Enlad to Roke is not short. Is there more to tell?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Only some old wives&#x2019; tales from the hills.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do the old wives say?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That all the fortunes witches read in smoke and water pools tell of ill, and that their love-potions go amiss. But these are people without true wizardry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fortune-telling and love-potions are not of much account, but old women are worth listening to. Well, your message will indeed be discussed by the Masters of Roke. But I do not know, Arren, what counsel they may give your father. For Enlad is not the first land from which such tidings have come.&#x201d;<br> <br>Arren&#x2019;s trip from the north, down past the great isle Havnor and through the Inmost Sea to Roke, was his first voyage. Only in these last few weeks had he seen lands that were not his own homeland, become aware of distance and diversity, and recognized that there was a great world beyond the pleasant hills of Enlad, and many people in it. He was not yet used to thinking widely, and so it was a while before he understood. &#x201c;Where else?&#x201d; he asked then, a little dismayed. For he had hoped to bring a prompt cure home to Enlad.<br> <br>&#x201c;In the South Reach, first. Latterly even in the south of the Archipelago, in Wathort. There is no more magic done in Wathort, men say. It is hard to be sure. That land has long been rebellious and piratical, and to hear a Southern trader is to hear a liar, as they say. Yet the story is always the same: the springs of wizardry have run dry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But here on Roke&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Here on Roke we have felt nothing of this. We are defended here from storm and change and all ill chance. Too well defended, perhaps. Prince, what will you do now?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I shall go back to Enlad when I can bring my father some clear word of the nature of this evil and of its remedy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Once more the Archmage looked at him, and this time, for all his training, Arren looked away. He did not know why, for there was nothing unkind in the gaze of those dark eyes. They were impartial, calm, compassionate.<br> <br>All in Enlad looked up to his father, and he was his father&#x2019;s son. No man had ever looked at him thus, not as Arren, Prince of Enlad, son of the Ruling Prince, but as Arren alone. He did not like to think that he feared the Archmage&#x2019;s gaze, but he could not meet it. It seemed to enlarge the world yet again around him, and now not only Enlad sank to insignificance, but he himself, so that in the eyes of the Archmage he was only a small figure, very small, in a vast scene of sea-girt lands over which hung darkness.<br> <br>He sat picking at the vivid moss that grew in the cracks of the marble flagstones, and presently he said, hearing his voice, which had deepened only in the last couple of years, sound thin and husky: &#x201c;And I shall do as you bid me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your duty is to your father, not to me,&#x201d; the Archmage said.<br> <br>His eyes were still on Arren, and now the boy looked up. As he had made his act of submission he had forgotten himself, and now he saw the Archmage: the greatest wizard of all Earthsea, the man who had capped the Black Well of Fundaur and won the Ring of Erreth-Akbe from the Tombs of Atuan and built the deep-founded sea wall of Nepp; the sailor who knew the seas from Astowell to Selidor; the only living Dragonlord. There he knelt beside a fountain, a short man and not young, a quiet-voiced man, with eyes as deep as evening.<br> <br>Arren scrambled up from sitting and knelt down formally on both knees, all in haste. &#x201c;My lord,&#x201d; he said, stammering, &#x201c;let me serve you!&#x201d;<br> <br>His self-assurance was gone, his face was flushed, his voice shook.<br> <br>At his hip he wore a sword in a sheath of new leather figured with inlay of red and gold; but the sword itself was plain, with a worn cross-hilt of silvered bronze. This he drew forth, all in haste, and offered the hilt to the Archmage, as a liegeman to his prince.<br> <br>The Archmage did not put out his hand to touch the sword hilt. He looked at it and at Arren. &#x201c;That is yours, not mine,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And you are no man&#x2019;s servant.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But my father said that I might stay on Roke until I learned what this evil is and maybe some mastery&#x2014;I have no skill, I don&#x2019;t think I have any power, but there were mages among my forefathers&#x2014;if I might in some way learn to be of use to you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Before your ancestors were mages,&#x201d; the Archmage said, &#x201c;they were kings.&#x201d;<br> <br>He stood up and came with silent, vigorous step to Arren, and taking the boy&#x2019;s hand made him rise. &#x201c;I thank you for your offer of service, and though I do not accept it now, yet I may, when we have taken counsel on these matters. The offer of a generous spirit is not one to refuse lightly. Nor is the sword of the son of Morred to be lightly turned aside!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now go. The lad who brought you here will see that you eat and bathe and rest. Go on,&#x201d; and he pushed Arren lightly between the shoulder blades, a familiarity no one had ever taken before, and which the young prince would have resented from anyone else; but he felt the Archmage&#x2019;s touch as a thrill of glory. For Arren had fallen in love.<br> <br>He had been an active boy, delighting in games, taking pride and pleasure in the skills of body and mind, apt at his duties of ceremony and governing, which were neither light nor simple. Yet he had never given himself entirely to anything. All had come easily to him, and he had done all easily; it had all been a game, and he had played at loving. But now the depths of him were wakened, not by a game or dream, but by honor, danger, wisdom, by a scarred face and a quiet voice and a dark hand holding, careless of its power, the staff of yew that bore near the grip, in silver set in the black wood, the Lost Rune of the Kings.<br> <br>So the first step out of childhood is made all at once, without looking before or behind, without caution, and nothing held in reserve.<br> <br>Forgetting courtly farewells he hurried to the doorway, awkward, radiant, obedient. And Ged the Archmage watched him go.<br> <br>GED STOOD AWHILE BY THE fountain under the ash tree, then raised his face to the sun-washed sky. &#x201c;A gentle messenger for bad news,&#x201d; he said half-aloud, as if talking to the fountain. It did not listen, but went on talking in its own silver tongue, and he listened to it awhile. Then, going to another doorway, which Arren had not seen, and which indeed very few eyes would have seen no matter how close they looked, he said, &#x201c;Master Doorkeeper.&#x201d;<br> <br>A little man of no age appeared. Young he was not, so that one had to call him old, but the word did not suit him. His face was dry and colored like ivory, and he had a pleasant smile that made long curves in his cheeks. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter, Ged?&#x201d; said he.<br> <br>For they were alone, and he was one of the seven persons in the world who knew the Archmage&#x2019;s name. The others were the Master Namer of Roke; and Ogion the Silent, the wizard of Re Albi, who long ago on the mountain of Gont had given Ged that name; and the White Lady of Gont, Tenar of the Ring; and a village wizard in Iffish called Vetch; and in Iffish again, a house-carpenter&#x2019;s wife, mother of three girls, ignorant of all sorcery but wise in other things, who was called Yarrow; and finally, on the other side of Earthsea, in the farthest west, two dragons: Orm Embar and Kalessin.<br> <br>&#x201c;We should meet tonight,&#x201d; the Archmage said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go to the Patterner. And I&#x2019;ll send to Kurremkarmerruk, so that he&#x2019;ll put his lists away and let his students rest one evening and come to us, if not in flesh. Will you see to the others?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; said the Doorkeeper, smiling, and was gone; and the Archmage also was gone; and the fountain talked to itself all serene and never ceasing in the sunlight of early spring.<br> <br>SOMEWHERE TO THE WEST OF the Great House of Roke, and often somewhat south of it, the Immanent Grove is usually to be seen. There is no place for it on maps, and there is no way to it except for those who know the way to it. But even novices and townsfolk and farmers can see it, always at a certain distance, a wood of high trees whose leaves have a hint of gold in their greenness even in the spring. And they consider&#x2014;the novices, the townsfolk, the farmers&#x2014;that the Grove moves about in a mystifying manner. But in this they are mistaken, for the Grove does not move. Its roots are the roots of being. It is all the rest that moves.<br> <br>Ged ...</p><h2>The Imaginary Girlfriend</h2><p>The Imaginary Girlfriend is a candid memoir of the writers and wrestlers who played a role in John Irving&#39;s development as a novelist and as a wrestler. It also portrays a father&#39;s dedication - Irving coached his two sons to championship titles. It is an illuminating, concise work, a literary treasure.</p><p>John Irving was born in Exeter, New Hampshire, in 1942, and he once admitted that he was a &#39;grim&#39; child. Although he excelled in English at school and knew by the time he graduated that he wanted to write novels, it was not until he met a young Southern novelist named John Yount, at the University of New Hampshire, that he received encouragement. &#39;It was so simple,&#39; he remembers. &#39;Yount was the first person to point out that anything I did except writing was going to be vaguely unsatisfying.&#39; In 1963, Irving enrolled at the Institute of European Studies in Vienna, and he later worked as a university lecturer. His first novel, Setting Free the Bears, about a plot to release all the animals from the Vienna Zoo, was followed by The Water-Method Man, a comic tale of a man with a urinary complaint, and The 158-Pound Marriage, which exposes the complications of spouse-swapping. Irving achieved international recognition with The World According to Garp, which he hoped would &#39;cause a few smiles among the tough-minded and break a few softer hearts&#39;. The Hotel New Hampshire is a startlingly original family saga, and The Cider House Rules is the story of Doctor Wilbur Larch - saint, obstetrician, founder of an orphanage, ether addict and abortionist - and of his favourite orphan, Homer Wells, who is never adopted. A Prayer for Owen Meany features the most unforgettable character Irving has yet created. A Son of the Circus is an extraordinary evocation of modern day India. He is the author of the international bestsellers A Widow for One Year, The Fourth Hand and Until I Find You. A collection of John Irving&#39;s shorter writing, Trying to Save Piggy Sneed, was published in 1993. Irving has also written the screenplays for The Cider House Rules and A Son of the Circus, and wrote about his experiences in the world of movies in his memoir My Movie Business. Irving has had a life-long passion for wrestling, and he plays a wrestling referee in the film of The World According to Garp. In his memoir, The Imaginary Girlfriend, John Irving writes about his life as a wrestler, a novelist and as a wrestling coach. He now writes full-time, has three children and lives in Vermont and Toronto."Concise, original, and enjoyable." -- <i><i>The Times</i></i><br><br>"His "inexpressible personal opinions" as a critic are wonderful, slaying many a sacred cow." -- <i>Tobias Jones, <i>Spectator</i></i><br><br>"Interesting and surprising revelations." -- <i>Michael Moran, <i>Literary Review</i></i><br><br>"The patent sincerity of his passion gives an appealing authenticity to this memoir...

Chronicling his stint on the barricades in Moscow in 1991, when he joined artists in resisting the coup whose failure ended the Soviet Union, his 2002 account of the rebirth of culture in Afghanistan following the fall of the Taliban, his insightful appraisal of a Myanmar seeped in contradictions as it slowly, fitfully pushes toward freedom, and many other stories of profound upheaval, this book provides a unique window onto the very idea of social change. With his signature brilliance and compassion, Solomon demonstrates both how history is altered by individuals, and how personal identities are altered when governments alter.<br> <br>A journalist and essayist of remarkable perception and prescience, Solomon captures the essence of these cultures. Ranging across seven continents and twenty-five years, <i>Far and Away </i>takes a magnificent journey into the heart of extraordinarily diverse experiences, yet Solomon finds a common humanity wherever he travels. Illuminating the development of his own genius, his stories are always intimate and often both funny and deeply moving.</p><p>Andrew Solomon is a professor of psychology at Columbia University, president of PEN American Center, and a regular contributor to&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker</i>, NPR, and&nbsp;<i>The New York Times Magazine</i>. A lecturer and activist, he is the author of&nbsp;<i>Far and Away: Essays from the Brink of Change: Seven Continents, Twenty-Five Years</i>; the National Book Critics Circle Award-winner&nbsp;<i>Far from the Tree: Parents, Children, and the Search for Identity,&nbsp;</i>which has won thirty additional national awards<i>;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Noonday Demon; An Atlas of Depression, which</i>&nbsp;won the 2001 National Book Award, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, and has been published in twenty-four languages.

Thankfully, the reader gets to experience both gifts throughout the pages of this deeply impressive and profoundly moving collection. Here is man whose curiosities are vast (politics, art, food, psychology, anthropology), and whose intellect is beautifully honed, but whose spirit is humble and whose heart is enormous. You will not only know the world better after having seen it through Solomon's eyes, you will also care about it more." Author: Elizabeth Gilbert<br><br>"This is a beautiful book, inspired by love of &#x2018;away' and uncertainty about &#x2018;home,' a celebration of freedom which valuably warns that freedom must sometimes be learned. Much more than 'travel writing,' it's a portrait of our world, made by someone who has been there."

But the only place they can run to is Ishawooa, Wyoming, where Jean&#x2019;s loved ones are dead and her father-in-law, the only person who could take them in, wishes that she was too. For a decade, Einar Gilkyson has blamed her for the accident that took his son&#x2019;s life, and he has chosen to go on living himself largely because his oldest friend couldn&#x2019;t otherwise survive. They&#x2019;ve been bound together like brothers since the Korean War and now face old age on a faltering ranch, their intimacy even more acute after Mitch was horribly crippled while Einar helplessly watched. <br><br>Of course, ten-year-old Griff knows none of this&#x2013;only that her father is dead and her mother has bad taste in men. But once she encounters this grandfather she&#x2019;d never heard about, and the black cowboy confined to the bunkhouse, with irrepressible courage and great spunk she attempts to turn grievous loss, wrath, and recrimination&#x2013;to which she&#x2019;s naturally the most vulnerable&#x2013;toward reconciliation and love. <br><br>Immediately compelling and constantly surprising, rich in character, landscape, and compassion, <i>An Unfinished Life</i> shows a novelist of extraordinary talents in the fullness of his powers.</p><p>Mark Spragg is the author of <i>Where Rivers Change Direction,</i> a memoir that won the Mountains &amp; Plains Booksellers Award, and <i>The Fruit of Stone,</i> a novel. Both were top-ten Book Sense selections and have been translated into seven languages. He lives in Cody, Wyoming.The sapwood snaps and shifts in the low-bellied stove, and the heat swells up against the roofboards and weathered fir planking, and the whole small building seems to groan. <br><br>It's the first cool night of the fall-a good night for a sweat-and Einar adjusts his wet back and ass in the webbing of the lawn chair. He feels the full weight of his seventy years and wishes he'd thought to bring a towel to drape over the webbing, but he was in here just this spring and hadn't remembered one then either. He scoops a dipper of water from the pail beside the chair and casts it across the stovetop where it sizzles and steams. <br><br>He wishes he'd have known this was the way it was going to be. <br><br>"Some old son of a bitch should've explained getting old to me," he says aloud and then bows his head against the wet pulse of heat. "Some old son of a bitch probably did and I wasn't listening." <br><br>The sweat drips from his nose and chin.<br><br>He reaches his denim shirt from where he hung it on a nail, soaks it in the bucket and then stands to wring it and mop his face and chest. <br><br>He spreads the shirt over the chair and sits back down, staring at the chair that stands empty before him, both chairs raised up on this platform into the heat. <br><br>Through the west window he watches the amber moonlight on the pasture and remembers the fall they skidded in the fieldstones and mortared them into the foundation under this board floor. The building was Griffin's idea. He'd said: "Dad, I need it. I really do."<br>"You need a sauna?" Einar had asked. <br>"I'm a Viking," the boy said. "It's what the Vikings did." <br><br>All of this twenty years ago, Mitch helping them frame the walls and the headers for the door and windows, and Griffin just a boy, but already used to working with the diligence of a man. And not a boy who'd ever asked for much. <br><br>They put in a south-facing window, this one to the west, and a square of double-pane glass in the slanting roof so they could see the stars. And a smaller pane low in the east wall for the benefit of the boy's dog, so Karl could lie on the porch and stare in at them. <br><br>When they were finished, Griffin took each man by a hand, standing between them, and bowed his head. "God bless this place," he said. He was serious, original, not just repeating something he'd heard. <br><br>"Is there anything else you need?" Mitch had asked. <br><br>The boy shaded his eyes, looking up at the man. "You could sit in here with us." Mitch's face shone even blacker in the sun, like wet obsidian. "Even though I'm no Viking?" He bent down over the boy. "Even though my great-granddad was an African man?" <br>"Does that mean no?" Griffin asked. <br><br>Mitch shoved him away playfully, the way men roughhouse with boys. "I guess I won't," he said. "I believe I've sweated enough in this life already." <br><br>Einar smiles at the clarity of the memory. He works his jaw, and his ears pop as if he were descending from a great height. The old dog fidgets on the porch, then settles its grayed jowls on its crossed forepaws and stares in through the little window. His name's Karl, but it's not the original Karl, just another dog taken from the town shelter, worked and fed and given a place to rest and grow lame. The first Karl lies buried behind the barn. Dead and buried like his son, Griffin, and his wife, Ella. <br><br>He straightens in the chair and wonders if the dog wishes it had a boy for company. Not his boy, just some other kid. He wonders what it is that dogs long for, or if they long. Maybe they just wait patiently for some improvement in their lives. He thinks he's a man who knows something of waiting, but the heat's gotten to him and he feels his stomach come up and shorten his breath. He cracks a window and sucks at the draft of night air. He drops his head back and stares through the window in the roof. <br><br>Pegasus has risen in the dark sky, poised as if for a run of magic, or that's what he used to think. Now he looks at the stars and sees only a silent, uncaring witness, and tonight feels this press of steam-thick heat, smells the odor of living wood reduced to ash. No magic. <br><br>He pops a wooden match with his thumbnail and lights a candle on the shelf by his elbow. He shakes the match out and looks down at his shriveled thighs and worn knees. His legs are white as summer cloud, blue-veined. At least his arms and shoulders are still strong, and he tightens his chest, the muscles in his neck. To the empty chair he says, "I've always been puny through the hindquarters, from the get-go. That's not news." <br><br>He scoots forward on the chair and takes the quart Mason jar from the shelf, holds it below him and pisses it half full before setting it down by the water bucket. He thumbs the sweat from his eyebrows and blinks at the walls and shelves, at the fist-size chunks of agate and quartz, the petrified wood and half a dozen of the boy's favorite books. There're the hawk feathers he'd hung on the walls. The skull of a black baldy bull. A map of Norway cut out of a National Geographic, carefully, with a razor blade. One of Iceland. The picture of a bearded man in a horned helmet, and another of a tall black man with a spear, balanced on a single leg. Both from National Geographic, the Norseman and the Senegalese hunter. The boy saw himself as dangerous, raised as he was by the descendants of warriors. <br><br>Einar stares down at the dog again and thinks it would be a fine thing to have that kind of focus. To have a small window, with something to stare at on the other side. He wishes for his own window and wonders what he might see. He wonders if Mitch has gone to sleep for the night. <br><br>He pushes out of his chair and opens the door. He carries the jar at his side and steps to the edge of the porchboards and sloshes the piss out into the darkness. He stands steaming in the cool air. The dog shifts but doesn't rise, its hips so brittle with arthritis that it moves only when it must. Einar turns back to the doorway and says, "Just like old times." <br><br>The dog blinks its clouded eyes and yawns, and Einar thinks this is an animal that should be called out into the tall weeds and shot in the head and buried next to its namesake. But he knows Mitch would never stand for it. Mitch believes in suffering as a right, a burden, even sacred, for both man and beast. <br><br><b> Two <br></b><br>She sits on the side of her bed and reaches back to run the flat of her hand over the sheet. She'd slept on her back, legs straight, arms at her sides. She can feel where the fabric's cool and where it's warm, just there, where her fingertips edge into the outline her sleeping body has made. She imagines the warmth whispering softly that she was here, but in a minute or two there'll be no proof she was ever in this bed, or even this trailer house, like she's invisible. She likes thinking that she can't be seen. It makes her smile. <br><br>She listens. There's the noise of her mother in the kitchen, the gurgle of the coffeemaker, water running at the sink. She stands and smooths the wrinkles on the bottom sheet, pulls up the top sheet and cotton blanket and tucks them tight, then fluffs the pillow at the head of the bed, her small hands working in the dim light. She climbs onto the bed and edges a fingernail under the heads of the thumbtacks pressed into the wallboard above the window. The tacks hold the brown bath towel she puts up every evening for a curtain, and they've worn divots in the wallboard, and little particles always fall out when she removes them, like sawdust, but she doesn't think the wallboards are made of wood. She doesn't fool herself about much. She knows everything in this trailer's fake, that it just tricks you into thinking it's real. <br><br>The window faces west, and she started putting the towel up in the summer so the setting sun wouldn't overheat her bed. But now it's the end of September, and she's grown used to sleeping in the darkened room. She folds the towel and places it on her pillow. Outside, a tractor is pulling a machine along the edge of a field, the cornstalks falling as it passes. She thinks she might ask Roy what this machine is called, not today, but sometime later. Roy puts guardrails up along the county roads, and since he needs machines to do that she thinks he might know what this one is called. <br><br>On the north side of the cornfield there's the interstate, with the cars and big trucks heading east and west filled with people who know nothing about her. She wonders if anyone ever looks her way, or imagines what it's like to live here. If they even notice the three crooked rows of old trailer houses, whose trees aren't big enough yet to climb or to shade the flat metal roofs. The dog next door barks, and she remembers it's Thursday and the garbage truck has turned in off the lane. She's never heard the neighbor dog's name. <br><br>She kneels by the bed and pulls out her suitcase and lifts it up on the blanket. Its clasp is rusted, its corners scuffed and peeling. <br><br>The first Thursday morning she saw the garbage truck she thought it looked a lot safer than the trailer houses, and all summer she prayed that if a tornado came it would be on a Thursday morning when she could hide in the garbage truck.

Strangely compelled, Antar initiates a search into the facts behind the disappearance of the enigmatic L. Murugan, and is unwittingly drawn into a bizarre alternate history of medical science. <p>Leaping backward in time, we join Murugan in Calcutta in 1995, as he follows the twisted threads of science, counter-science and ritual back a hundred years further to the laboratory of Ronald Ross, the British scientist who discovered how malaria is transmitted to humans. Obsessed with the weird, fortuitous coincidences that led to Ross' groundbreaking discovery, Murugan has stumbled upon evidence of an impossible ongoing experiment in controlled destiny, protected by a powerful unseen society that moves the world in secret and in silence. </p><p>Suddenly, every fact hitherto known can no longer be trusted, for everything has been revealed to be other than it appears. In this steamy, overcrowded city of clashing cultures and hidden faces, L. Murugan has opened a Pandora's Box that carefully orchestrated death and misdirection have long kept shut. And the truth that is revealed will have momentous con sequences--for Murugan, for Antar, for a troubled female journalist and an exquisite Indian celebrity...for everyone and everything human. </p></p><p><i>The Calcutta Chromosome</i> is one of those books that's marketed as a mainstream thriller even though it is an excellent science fiction novel (It won the prestigious Arthur C. Clarke Award). The main character is a man named Antar, whose job is to monitor a somewhat finicky computer that sorts through mountains of information. When the computer finds something it can't catalog, it brings the item to Antar's attention. A string of these seemingly random anomalies puts Antar on the trail of a man named Murugan, who disappeared in Calcutta in 1995 while searching for the truth behind the discovery of the cure for malaria. This search for Murugan leads, in turn, to the discovery of the Calcutta Chromosome, which can shift bits of personality from one person to another.

As a child growing up in Los Angeles, I used to wish that my huge, congested city were more like the places in the books that I loved - places where forests grew and seasons changed, where animals talked and anything was possible. I envied those characters who slid down rabbit holes, or visited with Charlotte and Wilbur, or flew with Peter Pan, or floated with Mary Poppins, or journeyed to Oz.<p>Since I couldn't actually visit these wonderful worlds (except, of course, by reading), I made little imaginary worlds of my own, using the materials at hand. My favorite project was an enormous dollhouse in my closet. The house was filled both with "store-bought" toys, and with dolls and creatures which I made myself, from paper, cloth and clay. I'd lose myself for hours making up stories about these characters. I loved to make them treasures from scraps of this and that: a paper doily would become a lace tablecloth; half a walnut-shell would be a baby's cozy cradle; a postage stamp would make a lovely portrait on the wall. Around the dollhouse I painted a mural, a fanciful landscape of forests, fields, mountains, blue skies - the world that I wished I could live in.</p><p>I lived in Los Angeles until I was 17, then left to study at U.C. Berkeley where I received a BA in English and later a teaching credential. After reading to young children as a teacher for several years, I had a strong desire to make my own books. My first picture book was published in 1988, and eighteen have followed. (Sometimes I illustrate other authors' stories, sometimes my own.) Like all authors and illustrators, I love to make up characters, and build stories and environments around them. To make my pictures I combine many media: watercolor, gouache, ink, colored pencils, pastels, markers, crayons -- anything that works! I also use lots of collage. As I did in childhood, I snip and glue old scraps into new shapes: a piece of wool becomes a lion's mane or a child's hair. A doily, snipped to bits, becomes a snowstorm.</p><p>Like my collages, my stories are also about the power of imagination to transform old into new, familiar into fantastical. In the book <b>The Lion And The Little Red Bird</b>, a lion turns his tail into a paintbrush, and the walls of his cave into a sunlit, painted world. In <b>The Paper Princess</b>, a drawing on paper becomes full of possibilities: by turns, it is a paper doll, a crumbled wad of litter, a birthday card, and a beloved doll again. The child in <b>Hooray, A Pinata!</b> imagines that a dog pi�ata is a favorite pet. Ernst the crocodile in <b>The Puddle Pail</b> sees ordinary rain puddles as sparkling, collectible treasures . The girl in <b>A Monster In The House</b> imagines her baby brother to be a giant, messy, screaming, toe-sucking, hair-pulling monster. And in my newest book, <b>Sun Bread</b>, a baker brightens a bleak winter by shaping bread dough into a warm, glowing, life-giving sun.</p><p>Although I love creating imaginary worlds, I also enjoy drawing real places. Three of the books I've illustrated take place in big U.S. cities. <b>Abuela</b>, by Arthur Dorros, is set in New York. <b>City By The Bay</b>, by Tricia Brown, is "a magical journey around San Fransisco." And <b>City Of Angels</b>, by Julie Jaskol and Brian Lewis, explores my home city of L.A. The life,energy, textures and wealth of detail in cities inspire my collages.</p><p>I'm very inspired as well by my children, Mia and Ben (ages nine and four), my husband Paul, our two dogs and our cat. They all appear in many forms and disguises in my books! My family and I live in the town of Albany, California, next door to Berkeley and across the bay from San Fransisco. From our window, we can see the Golden Gate Bridge, and the boats on San Fransisco Bay.</p><p>copyright � 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

Its story line and artwork both have unusual and unexpected qualities that work together to generate a magical, light mood. A little bird and a lion, friends although they don't understand one another's language, are inexplicably happy when they're together. The bird loves the sight of the lion's tail, which changes color daily. When the lion brings the bird into his cave, she understands the changes; the lion uses his tail as a paint brush for creating beautiful murals. In light of this knowledge, she sings her happiest song for him as their friendship deepens. Kleven's collages incorporate pastels, ink, paper, and wool. Their beautiful colors, surprising textures, and striking details give emotion and meaning to the story. She is especially successful in depicting the lion's gentleness and in suggesting the feelings that bond these two, which provides the power behind the story and fuel for readers' interest. A unique and worthwhile contribution to any collection. --Dorothy Houlihan, formerly at White Plains Public Library, NY<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bailout: An Inside Account of How Washington Abandoned Main Street While Rescuing Wall Street</h2><p>&#x201c;<i>Bailout </i>is a jaw-dropping play-by-play of how the Treasury Department bungled the financial bailouts...With a prosecutor&#x2019;s logic and copious footnotes, Barofsky makes it clear that things are rarely what they seem in Washington.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>USA TODAY</i><br><br>At the height of the financial crisis in 2008, Neil Barofsky gave up his job as a prosecutor in the esteemed US Attorney&#x2019;s Office in New York City, where he had convicted drug kingpins, Wall Street executives, and perpetrators of mortgage fraud, to become the inspector general in charge of overseeing administration of the bailout money. From the onset, his efforts to protect against fraud and to hold big banks accountable for how they spent taxpayer money were met with outright hostility from Treasury officials in charge of the bailouts.<br> <br>In this bracing, page-turning account Barofsky offers an insider&#x2019;s perspective on the mishandling of the $700 billion TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) bailout fund. With vivid behind-the-scenes detail, he reveals the extreme lengths to which our government officials were willing to go in order to serve the interests of Wall Street firms at the expense of the broader public&#x2014;and at the expense of effective financial reform.<br> <br><i>Bailout</i> is a riveting account of Barovsky&#x2019;s plunge into the political meat grinder of Washington, as well as a vital revelation of just how captured by Wall Street our political system is and why the too-big-to-fail banks have become even bigger and more dangerous in the wake of the crisis.</p><p>Neil Barofsky&nbsp;served as the Special Inspector General in charge of overseeing TARP from December 2008 until March 2011. For eight years prior, he was a federal prosecutor in the US Attorney&#x2019;s Office for the Southern District of New York, during which time he headed the Mortgage Fraud Group. Currently, Neil Barofsky is a senior fellow at New York University School of Law. An alum of the University of Pennsylvania and the New York University School of Law, this is his first book.Bailout <br>FOREWORD TO THE PAPERBACK EDITION<br> <br><br> <br>IN WRITING BAILOUT, I was given the opportunity to relive the tumultuous twenty-seven months of my life that are recounted in the pages that follow. It was a harrowing time, both for me and for the country, but it was an experience I will always treasure. As a line prosecutor in Manhattan, I never dreamed I would have the opportunity to serve my country at such a crucial time, and while I certainly had more than my fair share of setbacks, I believe that the work we did at the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) played an important role in protecting TARP from greater abuse and in bringing to justice those who sought to criminally profit from it.<br> <br>Although I was initially reluctant to take the job in Washington, I felt it was my duty, and I felt a similar call to write this book, in order to bring attention to what I saw as a hijacking of both the bailouts and the government itself by a handful of Wall Street financial institutions and their executives. I saw how they were able to exert their power and influence to protect and reinforce a dangerous status quo that worked brilliantly for them but has left the rest of the country behind. In writing this book, I wanted to send a warning about what I see as a treacherous future given the banks&#x2019; continued dominance.<br> <br>Events that have happened since I finished the original hardcover version have unfortunately only further confirmed my fears about where we are headed as a country if we continue to ignore the dangers presented by banks deemed &#x201c;too big to fail.&#x201d; Specifically, in the past several months we have seen a parade of banking scandals that have reflected just as poorly on the government and its captured regulators as on the banks themselves.<br> <br>First, we learned of what appears to be a global conspiracy among several of the largest banks to manipulate one of the most important interest rate benchmarks in the world, the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which is used to set interest rates for everything from complex derivative contracts to home and auto loans. A few banks are supposed to send in estimates of their borrowing costs each day to the British Bankers&#x2019; Association, which then averages the reported numbers and issues the official LIBOR rate for that day. One of those reporting banks, Barclays, settled allegations that its employees had taken part in cooking the rate. The bank lied about its estimated costs in order to manipulate this number, originally so that its traders could rip off its counterparties and earn illicit profits, and then later to make it appear that the bank was in better financial shape than it actually was, thus potentially lowering its costs and fooling potential shareholders, regulators, and others.1 A number of other banks are also apparent subjects of the ongoing investigation, including the all-too-familiar triumvirate in banking scandals: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup.2<br> <br>As damning as the breathtaking arrogance, size, and scale of the alleged misconduct by the banks were the allegations indicating that one of the banks&#x2019; primary regulators, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and its president at the time, Timothy Geithner, were made aware by Barclays by April 2008 both of the ongoing manipulation and that other banks were involved.3 But rather than immediately alerting the Department of Justice or even calling in the banks subject to his jurisdiction and warning them that they needed to cease the manipulation immediately, Geithner took far more modest steps. He apparently did little more than send a memo to his regulatory counterparts in England, recommending that the rate-setting process be changed,4 and call a meeting of U.S. regulators, during which the New York Fed generally reported that the LIBOR process was vulnerable to potential manipulation but reportedly did not cite the actual manipulation to which Barclays had confessed.5<br> <br>This regulatory response was so remarkably tepid that Barclays actually continued to manipulate LIBOR for a full year after Geithner took the actions he later defended as &#x201c;necessary and appropriate&#x201d; which apparently included relying on the British regulators to &#x201c;fix this.&#x201d;6 Indeed, although at the time some suspicions were reported in the press that LIBOR was being manipulated,7 rather than alerting the public, Geithner effectively endorsed the rate by baking it into several bailout programs, using it as a benchmark to determine the interest rate that taxpayers would receive from AIG and in certain TARP programs. According to news reports, it wasn&#x2019;t until 2010 that a referral was made to the Department of Justice, and even then it came from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, not the New York Fed or Treasury.8<br> <br>A number of other banking scandals have also broken since Bailout&#x2019;s completion. Standard Chartered joined JPMorgan Chase in settling charges that they illicitly processed monetary transactions for institutions in nations such as Iran and Cuba,9 and a Senate Committee detailed HSBC&#x2019;s apparent facilitation of financial transactions for rogue organizations, including those potentially involved in terrorism or narcotics traf-ficking.10 The Department of Justice has also brought civil charges against Wells Fargo and Bank of America for defrauding the government of more than a billion dollars in connection with fraudulent mortgage activity that continued through 2009, well after the banks had accepted TARP funds. These cases, brought in October 2012, followed the settlement of similar charges against Citigroup and Deutsche Bank. Also in October, the New York State attorney general brought a broad civil case against JPMorgan Chase for fraud committed by Bear Stearns in the assembling and sale of mortgage-related securities during the run-up to the financial crisis, and he filed a similar case against Credit Suisse the following month. The SEC also settled cases against both JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse over the packaging and sale of similar securities.11<br> <br>To date, however, all of these cases and scandals have one thing in common. Not a single institution or senior executive has been criminally charged for the underlying conduct. And while there have been leaked news stories suggesting that some of the lower-level Barclays traders may in fact be charged criminally in the LIBOR case, it seems as if the likelihood of high-level criminal charges for cases related to the financial crisis or actions taken in its aftermath has diminished to close to zero. As the New York attorney general told reporters, he chose civil over criminal cases not necessarily because of a paucity of evidence, but because the authorities had waited too long to file criminal charges.12 The five-year statute of limitations in New York for criminal cases (as opposed to the six-year statute for civil cases) had run its course. Similarly, it now appears to be too late for the president&#x2019;s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, originally announced in October 2009, to do its promised job &#x201c;to hold accountable those who helped bring about the last financial meltdown.&#x201d;13<br> <br>There are a number of potential explanations for the failure to bring criminal cases, some of which are detailed in the pages that follow. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, federal law enforcement personnel and resources were understandably redirected toward counter-terrorism efforts, creating a significant shortfall in white-collar criminal investigative expertise. As a result, as I saw firsthand, by 2008 the Department of Justice lacked sophistication when it came to investigating complex accounting fraud cases.<br> <br>But there was another reason for the lack of cases: a staggering absence of referrals from regulators&#x2014;such as Geithner&#x2019;s New York Fed&#x2014;to the Department of Justice. As William K. Black, a banking regulator during the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s, has explained, prosecutors back then leaned heavily on banking experts at the regulatory agencies to refer and shape the cases, with Black&#x2019;s agency making 30,000 referrals to the Department of Justice relating to frauds committed by the banks.14 In contrast, Black reported that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision, the two bank regulators housed at Treasury, had made only a handful of referrals in connection with the current crisis.15 Also, despite the promising announcement of the president&#x2019;s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, there was never a significant commitment of investigative and prosecutorial resources to focus exclusively on sophisticated crisis-related crimes.<br> <br>The absence of cases is likely also related to the power, influence, and control in Washington of the largest banks. The entire federal regulatory and political apparatus coalesced during the crisis and in the aftermath around one goal&#x2014;to rescue the &#x201c;too big to fail&#x201d; banks by any means necessary, with trillions of taxpayer dollars flowing out the door with few conditions and little accountability. With Treasury having invested so much time, effort, and treasure into saving the big banks, it was simply inconceivable that the Department of Justice could have sought criminal indictments against any of the largest banks or their top executives. Doing so would have risked causing them to fail, thereby undoing all of Treasury&#x2019;s and the Federal Reserve&#x2019;s efforts and putting the entire financial system at risk once again.<br> <br>These problems, of course, endure, with the largest banks now nearly 25 percent bigger than they were before the crisis. If they were too big to fail in 2008, they became too big to jail in 2009. Worst of all, Wall Street knows this to be true, and each settlement of a civil case on favorable terms, and with no accountability for the individuals who committed the fraudulent acts, reinforces the most dangerous perception of all: for a select group of executives and institutions, crime pays. Why not risk crossing the line and continue to perpetrate fraud in the assembling and sale of mortgages if the penalty for getting caught is a fine that can be paid off with a few days or weeks of earnings? Why worry about violating sanctions in order to profit illegally by laundering money for terrorist-sponsoring states? Why not rip off investors by selling bonds that are designed to fail so that you can profit from your bet against them?16 Why not spend ten years defrauding the Federal Housing Administration? You know you&#x2019;ll get to keep all of the ill-gotten profits if you go undetected, and on the off chance that you&#x2019;re caught, your shareholders will pay a minor fine that will not affect your bottom line. In other words, the complete lack of meaningful consequences&#x2014;financial or penal&#x2014;for those committing these frauds encourages future fraudulent conduct.<br> <br>Ultimately, the financial crisis was a game of incentives gone wild, and the lack of accountability in the aftermath of the crisis only reinforced those bad incentives. We had a chance to bring real accountability to the system in 2009 with the announcement of the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, but it was left underfunded and under-resourced. We had a second chance to fix the system in 2010 by breaking up the largest banks through regulatory reform, but the banks&#x2014;with a healthy assist from Geithner and the Treasury Department&#x2014;won that battle too. And we had an election in 2012 that could also have been an opportunity for meaningful change. But both candidates staunchly defended the status quo, which maintained the size and power of the banks, even as they made the incredible claim that they would never bail them out again. I fear that we may not have many more opportunities left before it is too late, and that meaningful reform will arise only out of the ashes of the next economic conflagration. That is a sequel I would prefer not to have to write.</p><h2>A Village to Village Guide to Hiking the Camino De Santiago: Camino Frances : St Jean - Santiago - Finisterre</h2><p>Fully updated April 2016, and now lighter than ever!

The author, Garry Kasparov, is the world number one, and by common consent, the greatest player ever. The subject of the book, Bobby Fischer, is the only American to have become world champion and is probably the greatest natural talent the world has ever seen.<br><br>In the period between 1955 and 1972, Fischer, more or less single-handedly, took on the might of the Soviet Chess Empire and won. During this time Fischer scored astonishing successes, the likes of which had not been seen before. These included 11/11 in the 1963/64 U.S. Championship and match victories (en route to the World Championship) by the score of 6-0 against two of the strongest players in the world, Mark Taimanov and Bent Larsen. The climax of Fischer's campaign was his unforgettable match win in Reykjavik in 1972 against Boris Spassky.<br><br>However, Fischer is not only remembered for his achievements over-the-board, he is almost equally well-known for his temperamental behavior away from the board. He made extreme demands of all those around him, including tournament organizers. When these demands were not met he often refused to play. The 1972 match against Spassky required the intervention of no less than Henry Kissinger to smooth things over. In 1975, when he was due to defend his title against Anatoly Karpov, Fischer was completely unable to agree terms with FIDE (the World Chess Federation) and was defaulted. After this, he more or less gave up chess, playing only once, a "return" match against Spassky in 1992.<br><br>In this book, a must for all serious chess players, Kasparov deeply analyzes Fischer's greatest games and assesses the legacy of this great American genius.<br></p><p><b>Garry Kasparov</b> is generally regarded as the greatest chess player ever. He was the thirteenth World Champion, holding the title between 1985 and 2000. His tournament record is second to none, featuring numerous wins in the world's major events, often by substantial margins. Over the last few years he has taken first prize in ten consecutive major international events.<br></p><h2>The Priest, the Woman, and the Confessional</h2><p>Former priest reveals a tragic danger of the confessional. <br><br>What happens when women are commanded, under penalty of eternal damnation, to confess to a man their deepest sexual thoughts and sins?<br><br>Former priest, Charles Chiniquy, continually dealt with this problem. He personally heard the confessions of over 200 priests. All but 21 admitted falling prey to Satan's devices in this area.<br><br>This book reverently and tastefully exposes why confession of sins to a man cannot be of God. You'll see how this practice destroys both the priest and the person doing the confessing.</p><p>As a child, Chiniquy memorized scriptures at his mother's knee and developed a deep love for God. Becoming a priest, he wanted desperately to place full trust in his church, but was hit by waves of doubt as his church claimed adherence to the Gospel, yet violated it at every turn. His jealous superiors falsely accused him, but Abraham Lincoln, a young lawyer from Illinois, defended him and saved his reputation. Chiniquy proved that it was the Jesuits who later killed Lincoln, and explains why in his book "50 Years in the Church of Rome". <br><br>Finally, after twenty-five years as a priest in the Roman Catholic Church, his bishop demanded that he give up his precious Bible, and pledge blind obedience to the church. After a dark night of struggle, he emerged gloriously saved, and led almost the entire Catholic population of St. Anne, Illinois to trust in Christ alone.</p><h2>Yo Millard Fillmore!: (And all those other Presidents you don&#39;t know)</h2><p>Here's a fast, easy way to learn all the Presidents of the United States (forever) in less than 20 minutes!

She lives in San Francisco and Paris.<i>Chapter One<br><br></i><br> The sun was so brilliant nearly everyone was squinting, though it was only eleven o'clock in the morning. The tiniest of breezes ruffled the women's hair. The day was so beautiful there was a kind of agony to it, an amazing silence, and all one could hear in the silences were birds, a quiet chirping, a sudden shrieking, and the overwhelming smell of flowers. . . lily of the valley, gardenias, freesia, buried in a carpet of moss. But Ward Thayer saw none of it and he seemed to hear nothing at all. His eyes had been closed for several minutes, and when he opened them, he stared for the longest time, almost like a zombie, looking colorless, so unlike the image everyone had of him. . . had had for the last forty years. There was nothing dashing or exciting or even handsome about Ward Thayer this morning. He stood immobilized in the brilliant sunlight, watching nothing, his eyes closed again, almost too tightly, he pressed his eyelids tightly together, and for a moment he wanted never to open them again, as she had not, as she never would again.<br><br> There was a voice, droning softly in the distance, saying something, sounding no different than the hum of insects buzzing near the flowers. And he felt nothing. Nothing. Why? Why did he feel nothing, he asked himself? Had he felt nothing for her? Had it all been a lie? He felt a wave of panic wash over him. . . he couldn't remember her face. . . the way she wore her hair. . . the color of her eyes. . . his eyes flew open brusquely, tearing the lids apart like hands that had been clasped, skin that had once upon a time been grafted. The sun blinded him in an instant, and he saw only a flash of light and smelled the flowers, as a bee hummed lazily past him, and the pastor said her name. Faye Price Thayer. There was a muffled popping sound to his left and the lightning of a camera exploded in his eyes, as the woman beside him pressed his arm.<br><br> He looked down at her, his eyes adjusting to the light again, and suddenly he remembered. Everything he had forgotten was reflected in his daughter's eyes. The younger woman looked so much like her, yet how different they were. There would never be another woman like Faye Thayer. They all knew that, and he knew it best of all. He looked at the pretty blonde beside him, remembering it all, and longing silently for Faye.<br><br> His daughter stood tall and sedate. She was plainer than Faye had been. Her smooth blond hair was pulled tightly into a knot, and beside her stood a serious-looking man, who touched her arm often. They were on their own now, all of them, each one different, separate, yet part of a larger whole, part of Faye. . . and of him as well.<br><br> Was she truly gone? It seemed impossible, as tears rolled solemnly down his cheeks and a dozen photographers leapt forward to record his pain, to put on front pages around the world. The grieving widower of Faye Price Thayer. He was hers now, in death, as he had been hers in life. They were all hers. All of them. The daughters, the son, the co-workers, the friends, and they were all there to honor the memory of the woman who would never come again.<br><br> The family stood beside him in the front row. His daughter Vanessa, her bespectacled young man, and beside him, Vanessa's twin, Valerie, with hair of flame, a golden face, a perfect black silk dress which clung to her breathtakingly, her success stamped on her unmistakably, and beside her an equally dazzling man.<br><br> They made such a beautiful pair one had to stare at them, and it pleased Ward to see how much Val looked like Faye. He had never noticed it quite so much before, but he saw it now. . . . And Lionel, who looked so like her too, though more quietly. Tall and handsome and blond, sensual, elegant, and delicate, yet at the same time proud. He stood staring into the distance now, remembering the others he had known and loved. . . . Gregory and John, lost brother, treasured friend. He thought too of how well Faye had known Lionel, better than anyone perhaps. She had known him better than he knew himself. . . and as well as he himself knew Anne, standing beside him now, prettier than she had been before, so much more confident, and still so young, in sharp contrast to the gray-haired man who held her hand.<br><br> They were all there in the end. They had come to pay homage to all that she had been. Actress, director, legend, wife, mother, friend. There were those who had envied her, those she had driven too hard and wanted too much from. Her family knew that best of all. She had expected so much of them, yet given so much in return, driven herself so hard, gone so far. Ward remembered it all as he looked at all of them, all the way back to that first time in Guadalcanal. And now here they were, a lifetime past, and each of them remembering her as she had been, as she once was, as she was to them. It was a sea of faces in the bright Los Angeles sun. All of Hollywood had turned out for her. A last salute, a final smile, a tender tear, as Ward turned to glance at the family he had built with her, all of them so strong and beautiful. . . as she had been. How proud she would have been to see them now, he thought, tears burning his eyes again. . . how proud they were of her. . . finally. It had taken a long time. . . and now she was gone. . . it seemed impossible to believe when only yesterday. . . only yesterday they'd been in Paris. . . the South of France. . . New York. . . Guadalcanal.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>A Sufi Saint of the Twentieth Century: Shaikh Ahmad al-Alawi (Golden Palm Series)</h2><p>'Almost a prerequisite for any serious study of Sufism in European languages': this was the verdict of Seyyed Hossein Nasr in his review of the first edition of the book. According to the <i>Journal of Near Eastern Studies</i>, it is 'one of the most thorough and intimately engaging books on Sufism to be produced by a Western scholar'. Certainly there is nothing second-hand about it. The author lets Sufis speak for themselves and, in a series of unusual and absorbing texts mainly translated from Arabic, he gives a vivid picture of life in a North African Sufi order. Against this background stands the unforgettable figure of the Algerian Shaikh who was head of the order from 1909 until his death in 1934. The last few chapters are mainly devoted to his writings, which include some penetrating aphorisms, and which end with a small anthology of his remarkable mystic poems.<br></p><p>The late Dr Martin Lings, formerly Keeper of Oriental Manuscript at the British Museum and the British Library, is the author of the best-selling title <i>Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources</i>, and of <i>What is Sufism?</i>, <i>The Book of Certainty</i>, <i>Sufi Poems: A Mediaeval Anthology</i>, and <i>The Holy Qur'an: Translations of Selected Verses</i>, all published by the Islamic Texts Society.<p></p><i>'One of the most thorough and intimately engaging books on Sufism to be produced by a Western scholar.' <br> </i><br><br><em>'A masterly study of a man whose sanctity recalled the golden age of medieval mystics.

He was surrounded, twenty four hours a day, by the small group of intimates and personal attendants who made up the staff of his Privy Chamber. They organised his daily life, kept him amused and acted as the landline between the king and the formal machinery of government. These men, intermarried, interbred and close knit even in their mutual feuding, were supremely well placed to rig politics and patronage for their own benefit. Their influence was important and sometimes decisive: factions in the Privy Chamber destroyed Anne Boleyn, they frustrated the Catholic reaction of the 1540s, and, by doctoring Henry&#39;s will, prepared the way for the full blooded Protestantism of his son&#39;s reign. &#34;The Reign of Henry VIII&#34; is not so much a book about Henry VIII.

Here, Pinto turns his attention to intimate and personal spaces. Pinto succeeds in giving each of the forty bedrooms in this book his unequaled touch of grandeur while evoking its owner's personality. Under Pinto's direction, the bedroom becomes a fantasy-like oasis adorned with water elements, fine damasks, gorgeously colored mosaics, fancy brocades, or neo-classical columns. The resulting rooms are contemporary bedrooms&#x2014;some more appropriately described as suites rather than single rooms&#x2014;from Europe and North America that evoke a spectrum of classical styles updated for the finest in twenty-first century living.Alberto Pinto's bedrooms are spaces that are grand and yet intimate. Each one will be an inspiration to anyone who is designing or redecorating a bedroom.</p><p>Alberto Pinto is based in Paris and is the author of Alberto Pinto Orientalism, Alberto Pinto Classics and Alberto Pinto Moderns. He has also written on color, antiques, flowers, and toys. He is the pre-eminent contemporary tastemaker in France.</p><h2>The Reluctant Surgeon: A Biography of John Hunter</h2><p>John Hunter was a pioneering Scottish surgeon whose 18th-century experiments and practices were ahead of his time in many ways. Hunterian literature crowds the shelves of medical libraries the world over. The Britannica devotes more space to Hunter than to Linneaus, Pare, Harvey, Jenner, Lister, Simpson, Pasteur, Freud, or Fleming. Yet outside the scientific community the name today strikes only a dim spark of recognition, if any at all. Although his practical contributions were legion, none had the kind of dramatic impact, the easily grasped significance, that excites the lay imagination. What Hunter accomplished transcended specific discovery and technical invention. He introduced a new spirit of inquiry, a philosophy, which not only transformed the medical theory and practice of his epoch, but profoundly influenced scientific thinking everywhere down to our own times.</p><p></p><h2>God Don&#39;t like Ugly</h2><p>Great Read!

Rage took its place, dense and heavy, hot and seething.<br><br>Sooner or later, he had known he would see her. He had told himself it wouldn't matter, that seeing her again wouldn't affect him. She meant nothing to him, not anymore, not for nearly eight years.<br><br>But as she stepped off the wooden walkway, a ray of autumn sunlight gleamed against the jet-black curls on her shoulders and anger boiled up inside him, fury unlike he had known in years.<br><br>He watched her continue toward her sleek black four-horse carriage, the crossed-saber Aldridge crest glinting in gold on the side. She paused for a moment as one of the footmen hurried to open the door and he realized she wasn't alone. A small, dark-haired boy, nearly hidden in the voluminous folds of her skirt, hurried along beside her. She urged him up the iron steps and the child disappeared inside the elegant coach.<br><br>Instead of climbing the stairs herself, the woman turned and looked at him over her shoulder, her gray eyes finding him with unerring accuracy, as if she could feel his cold stare stabbing into the back of her neck. She gasped when she realized who it was, though she must have known, in a village as small as Swansdowne, one day their paths would cross.<br><br>Surely she had heard the gossip, heard of his return to Briarwood, the estate he had inherited from his maternal grandfather.<br><br>The estate he had meant to share with <em>her.</em><br><br>Their eyes locked, hers troubled, filled with some emotion he could not read. His own gaze held the bitterness and anger he made no effort to hide. He loathed her for what she had done, hated her with every ounce of his being.<br><br>It shocked him.<br><br>He had thought those feelings long past. For most of the last eight years, he had been away from England, a major in the British cavalry. He had fought in foreign wars, commanded men, sent some of them to their deaths. He had been wounded and nearly died himself.<br><br>He was home now, his injured leg making him no longer fit to serve. That and the vow he had made to his dying father. One day he would come back to Briarwood. He would make the estate his home as he had once intended.<br><br>Reese would rather have stayed in the army. He didn't belong in the country. He wasn't sure <em>where </em>he belonged anymore and he loathed his feelings of uncertainty nearly as much as he loathed Elizabeth.<br><br>She swallowed, seemed to sway a little on her feet as she turned away, climbed the steps and settled herself inside the carriage. She hadn't changed. With her raven hair, fine pale features, and petite, voluptuous figure, Elizabeth Clemens Holloway, Countess of Aldridge, was as beautiful at six-and-twenty as she had been at eighteen.<br><br>As she had been when she had declared her love and accepted his proposal of marriage.<br><br>His gaze followed the coach as it rolled off toward Aldridge Park, the palatial estate that had belonged to her late husband, Edmund Holloway, Earl of Aldridge. Aldridge had died last year at the age of thirty-three, leaving his wife a widow, leaving her with a son.<br><br>Reese spat into the dirt at his feet. Just the thought of Aldridge in Elizabeth's bed made him sick to his stomach.<br><br>Five years his senior, Edmund was already an earl when he had competed with Reese for Elizabeth's affections. She had been amused by the attentions of the handsome, sophisticated aristocrat, but she had been in love with Reese.<br><br>Or so she had said.<br><br>The carriage disappeared round a bend in the road and Reese's racing pulse began to slow. He was amazed at the enmity he still felt toward her. He was a man who had taught himself control and that control rarely abandoned him. He would not allow it to happen again.<br><br>Leaning heavily on his cane, the ache in his leg beginning to reach through the fury that had momentarily consumed him, he made his way to his own conveyance and slowly climbed aboard. Aldridge's widow and her son had no place in his life. Elizabeth was dead to him and had been for nearly eight years.<br><br>As dead as her husband, the man she had betrayed Reese to marry.<br><br>And he would never forgive her.<br><br>Elizabeth leaned against the tufted red velvet seat of her carriage. Her heart was hammering, battering against the wall of her chest. <em>Dear God, Reese.</em><br><br>She had known she would see him. She had prayed it would happen at some distant time in the future. Sometime after she had come to grips with the fact that he was living in the house they had once meant to share.<br><br><em>Dear God, Reese. </em>There was a day she thought never to see him again. Rumors had surfaced. Reese, a major in the cavalry, was missing in action somewhere in the Crimea. There were whispers he was dead. Then he had returned and the news had swept the countryside.<br><br>He was back at Briarwood, wounded in the war and retired from the army. He was home, living just a few miles from Aldridge Park. She should have been prepared and yet seeing him today...seeing the hatred in his brilliant blue eyes, made her chest squeeze with guilt and regret.<br><br>She knew how much he hated her. If she hadn't already been certain, she would have seen it in his icy stare today. Every pore in his sun-bronzed face exuded loathing. Every angry thought seemed to reach her across the distance between them. She hadn't seen him since that day nearly eight years ago that he had come home on leave and discovered she had wed another man.<br><br>Not since the day he had called her a whore and vowed that one day she would pay for her lies and deceit.<br><br>She had paid. Dear God, she had paid every day since she had married Edmund Holloway. She had done as her father demanded and wed a man not of her choosing.<br><br>But she had never stopped loving Reese.<br><br>Her heart squeezed. She thought of his hard, handsome features, so masculine, so incredibly attractive. In some ways, he looked the same as he had as a young man of twenty, tall and black-haired, his body hard-muscled and lean, his features sharply defined.<br><br>And yet he was a completely different man. He had been a little shy in his courtship of her, a little uncertain. Now he wore his masculinity like a comfortable shirt; it was clear in his unwavering stare, the way his gaze too boldly assessed her. There was a harshness in his features that hadn't been there when he was young, and a confidence and raw sense of authority that only made him more attractive.<br><br>"Mama...?"<br><br>Jared's small voice reached her from across the carriage. "Yes, sweetheart?" A headache had begun to form behind her eyes and she rubbed her temple against the pain.<br><br>"Who was that man?" Her son sat quietly on the opposite seat, his voice little more than a whisper. He wouldn't be talking at all, she knew, if he hadn't sensed her distress.<br><br>She forced herself to smile and patted the seat beside her. Jared scooted next to her and she settled an arm around his small shoulders.<br><br>"Major Dewar is an old friend, sweetheart." A complete and utter falsehood. The man loathed her and she didn't blame him. "He just got out of the army and he is returned to his home."<br><br>Jared just looked at her. He didn't ask more, simply gazed at her with his deep-set brown eyes, soulful eyes, she thought. Eyes far too worldly for a child so young, and far too full of loneliness.<br><br>Managing a smile, she began to point out the sights along the road as the carriage moved down the lane that cut through the rolling fields. It was mid-September, the leaves turning orange, gold and red. Two small boys played along the roadside tossing a ball back and forth, and Elizabeth pointed them out to Jared.<br><br>"Doesn't that look like fun? You like to play ball. Perhaps one of Mrs. Clausen's sons will play with you this afternoon." Mrs. Clausen was the housekeeper, a dear woman raising her daughter's orphaned grandsons, boys eight and nine years old. They liked Jared, but because of his shyness, rarely sought him out. "Why don't you ask them when we get home?"<br><br>Jared said nothing, but his gaze remained on the boys and the look in his eyes made a lump rise in her throat. As long as he remained at Aldridge Park, Jared would never come out of the shell he had built to protect himself. It was one more reason she had to leave.<br><br>Not <em>leave, </em>Elizabeth silently corrected. <em>Escape.</em><br><br>As long as her brother-in-law and his wife, Mason and Frances Holloway, lived at Aldridge Park, she was a prisoner in her own home.<br><br>Her headache continued to worsen, pounding away inside her skull as it often did these days. She was afraid of Mason. He was the sort of man who stood a little too close, touched her a little too often. She needed to leave, but she was certain he would simply come after her. She had no idea how far he would go to keep her and Jared&#x2014; now the Earl of Aldridge&#x2014;under his control. But she was certain there was little he would not do.<br><br>She was frightened. Not only for herself but for her son.<br><br>An image arose of Reese Dewar, strong, capable, a veteran of the war, the sort of man who would protect his family no matter the cost.<br><br>But Reese wasn't her husband and never would be.<br><br>And she had no one to blame but herself.<br><br>Reese returned to Briarwood, his mood dark and brooding. He tried not to think of Elizabeth but he couldn't seem to get her out of his head. What was there about her? How had she managed to keep a stranglehold over him for so many years? Why had no other woman been able to pierce the wall of his heart as she had done?<br><br>His manservant, Timothy Daniels, a brawny young corporal who had served with him for several years before being injured and sent home, arrived in the study just then.<br><br>"You are returned," Daniels said. "Is there anything you need, sir?" Tim had been out of work and hungry when he had appeared at Reese's door. In a few short weeks, he had become dedicated to Reese's welfare. With this damnable leg slowing him down, Reese was glad to have a man he could count on.<br><br>"I'm fine, Tim."<br><br>"Let me know if you need me."<br><br>Reese scowled. "I imagine I can survive a few hours studying these bloody damned ledgers." Though in truth, he hated paperwork and would far rather be out of doors, which Timothy, being a military man, seemed to understand.<br><br>"Aye, sir. Like I said&#x2014;"<br><br>"That will be all, corporal." Growing tired of the young man's overprotectiveness, Reese snapped out the words in his firmest military voice.<br><br>"Aye, sir." The door closed quietly, leaving Reese alone in the wood-paneled room. The study was his sanctuary, a comfortable chamber lined with books, a warm, inviting, masculine place where a fire blazed in the hearth and he could insulate himself from the memories that crept into other parts of the house.<br><br>In the days of their courtship, Elizabeth had been to Briarwood more than once. She loved the ivy that covered the white plaster walls of the manor and hung from the porch outside the front door, she had said. She loved the steep slate roof with its whimsical chimney pots that made the house look like a fairy tale dwelling.<br><br>She had made plans to paint the drawing room a pale shade of rose and add lace curtains, to hang flowered silk wallpaper behind the sofa. She loved the master's suite, she told him, loved how sunny it was, the way it looked out over the garden. She couldn't wait to share his big four-poster bed, a gift his grandfather had commissioned for his bride-to-be.<br><br>That thought led to one he didn't wish to recall and his loins began to fill. Bloody hell. All these years and seeing her once made him want her again. He forced himself to remember the way she had told him how much she loved him and how happy she would be to live at Briarwood as his wife.<br><br>Lies. All of them.<br><br>Just weeks after he had left for his assignment in London, she had broken her promise to marry him. Instead she had wed an earl, a man of untold wealth, and abandoned the younger son of a duke, a man who could provide a pleasant home and sufficient income but would never be extravagantly rich.<br><br>Reese ground his jaw. Since his return, thoughts of Elizabeth had begun to haunt him, memories he had buried years ago. Two days after he had discovered the news of her marriage, he had left Wiltshire County for good, gone back to London and asked to serve in the cavalry, knowing he would be assigned to duty somewhere far from English shores.<br><br>If he hadn't been wounded, if he hadn't promised his father, he would be there still.<br><br>His hand fisted on the top of the desk. Reese dragged in a deep breath and forced his mind back to the present. The ledgers sat open in front of him. He forced himself to concentrate and began to skim the pages. He would have to conquer his painful past and concentrate on the future if he meant to fulfill his obligations and make the fallow fields of Briarwood productive again.<br><br>Reese intended to see it done.<br><br>With her young son, Jared, walking close beside her, Elizabeth entered the magnificent entry of the huge Georgian mansion, Aldridge Park, her late husband's country estate. The property and all others entailed to the earldom, along with Edmund's vast fortune, now belonged to Jared, the recently titled seventh Earl of Aldridge.<br><br>The sound of footsteps echoing on the black-and-white marble floor drew her attention and Elizabeth looked up to see her sister-in-law, Frances Holloway, also dressed in black, float into the entry to greet them.<br><br>Frances's lips flattened out in disapproval. "I expected you home hours ago. Where have you been?" She was a thin woman, with high cheekbones and a long, narrow nose. Her greatest asset was her strength of will. Frances managed to turn things to suit her purpose no matter how difficult they might be, probably the reason her husband, Mason, had married her.<br><br></p><h2>Tart and Sweet: 101 Canning and Pickling Recipes for the Modern Kitchen: A Cookbook</h2><p>Think You Can't Can?

She lives in central Virginia.1 Canning Isn't Rocket Science<br><br>One of the most common misconceptions about canning is that it's hard. The craft still conjures up images of a 1930s-era housewife shucking a mountain of corn at her kitchen table while a pressure canner rattles and hisses nearby like a bomb about to explode. And for many years, this was a fairly accurate portrait. Before the advent of the processed food industry, people had to preserve food--lots of it--if they wanted to eat fruits and vegetables in February. In fact, we came across a home canning guide from 1935 that called for putting up 560 quarts of fruits and vegetables for a family of five every year. No wonder canning went the way of the carpet beater for so long.<br><br>Today, of course, people no longer have to preserve seasonal produce. They choose to do it because it's a delicious, homemade way to eat just a little bit closer to the land, whether you're making pickles from green market cucumbers or tomato sauce from your backyard bounty.<br><br>Yet anymore, it seems there's an excessively cautious If you're not careful, canning may kill you tone that surrounds the craft. One friend balked before digging into Jessie's homemade peach butter, "Wait, does this have botulism? Is it going to kill me?" Maybe it's because preserving has undergone a resurgence only within the past few years, so it still seems "new" to many, thus scarier than it actually is. Improvements in culinary science and revamped rules and regulations from the US Department of Agriculture have made canning safer than ever, but the flip side is that it now seems more nerve-racking than ever. Headspace, processing times, pH levels, altitude considerations--perusing a modern canning manual can feel like studying for a chemistry exam.<br><br>The truth: Canning couldn't be simpler, especially the kind we deal with here--water bath canning. In fact, very little has changed about canning since it was first invented by a French chef and confectioner (not a scientist, notably) more than 200 years ago. Which is to say, if you can boil water and chop produce, you can can like the best of them. Heck, committing to a 48-hour training program (the equivalent of 2 days) is all that's required to call yourself a Master Preserver.<br><br>Another fact: Canning won't kill you. We'll get more into the science later, but rest assured, the scary botulism spores you may have read about cannot grow in high-acid food. And the instructions and recipes in this book are written for high-acid canning--fruits, fruit spreads, acidified tomatoes, pickled products, relishes, chutneys, ketchup--products most modern canners are eager to preserve.<br><br>How Nutritious Is Canned Food?<br><br>A lot of people think canned food isn't nearly as nutritious as fresh, and for the most part, that's true--assuming the "fresh" stuff wasn't picked well before peak ripeness or shipped halfway around the world, lingering for days, even weeks in storage, which is often the case for the fruits and vegetables you'll find at your local grocery store.<br><br>The reason canned food is sometimes (and erroneously) thought of as a nutritional black hole is because food scientists have generally looked to vitamin C--which happens to be extrasensitive to heat, light, and oxygen-- as a measure of nutrient degradation. And it's true, vitamin C, along with equally sensitive B vitamins, degrades rapidly during canning. But they degrade just as rapidly during cooking. In fact, they degrade rapidly just after harvest. Studies have found that vitamin C loss during canning ranged from 10 to 90 percent. Losses during cooking ranged from 15 to 55 percent, while losses during refrigeration for 7 days ranged from 15 to 77 percent. Vitamin C just doesn't like to stick around for very long.<br><br>But fruits and vegetables are more than repositories for vitamin C and B vitamins. Studies have shown that fat-soluble nutrients such as vitamins A and E remain more or less constant during heat processing (and levels of disease-preventing carotenoids such as lycopene actually increase). Fiber, minerals, calcium, and potassium remain stable as well.<br><br>So to get the most nutritional bang for your preserving buck, try to can local, perfectly ripe, organic fruits and vegetables as soon as possible after harvest to preserve these valuable nutrients. During processing, remaining vitamin C and B vitamins, which are water soluble, may leach into the canning liquid, which can be added to other recipes and consumed.<br><br>All that aside, a lot of home canned food falls into the condiment/snack category (dilly beans, fruit spreads, salsas) anyway, which most people don't eat for nutritional purposes. They eat preserved goodies because they taste good and the ingredients are of the highest quality (close to home!), and making jams and pickles is rewarding and fun.<br><br>So . . . canning is easy. It's safe. You could even call it modern. We don't feel that canning is a throwback to another era, an attempt to recapture the halcyon days of Grandma's dilly beans or a romantic nod to a more rustic way of life when smocks and sunbonnets were at the height of fashion. Instead, we believe canning's resurgence can be attributed to the natural outgrowth of the locavore movement. Canning is an extension of the way people think about food and the environment today, whether you live in the city, like Kelly, or in the country, like Jessie.<br><br>That said, like all DIY hobbies, canning is not without its minor challenges. We've compiled a list of our top seven canning rules-- guidelines that will keep the craft fun, easy, and delicious, whether you're a new or longtime preserver.<br><br>1. THINK PINTS, NOT PECKS<br><br>There's no getting around it: Canning requires food prep--chopping, coring, seeding, and slicing. If you come across a recipe that calls for �ds of fruits and vegetables in multiples of 10 (you'll find only one in this book), you may want to step away from the stove top or call some friends for reinforcement (see rule 7). You'll be spending a long time in the kitchen, veering into "'30s housewife chore" territory.<br><br>Kelly speaks from experience on this one. How about the day she thought she'd have a swell time making strawberry jam from four cases of strawberries? By midafternoon she was sweating profusely, her fingertips were stained pink, and she'd scorched 3 gallons of the stuff. And she was still only half done!<br><br>Such experiences have made her a fan of small-batch canning--small yields of up to 6 pints or maybe 6 quarts per batch. Anything more than that and canning fatigue sets in. Of course, if you want to preserve an entire plum tree, by all means go for it, but the recipes in this book are scaled for those who don't have time or necessarily space to put up such a large haul. Kelly's recipes can be completed in 2 to 4 hours, tops, so you can get on with the rest of your day.<br><br>2. MAKE ONLY STUFF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO EAT<br><br>Sounds obvious, right? Yet sometimes canners end up preserving stuff simply because they can't bear to waste any fresh fruits and vegetables. Many times Jessie has made exotic-sounding recipes with names like Tropical Island Thunder simply because the main ingredient, the humble green bell pepper, was one that her backyard garden produced in spades--only to discover she had no interest in eating the stuff 6 months later. She couldn't pawn it off on friends, thus risk tarnishing her "canner's cred," and she couldn't bring herself to throw it out because of the work involved, so . . . she was stuck with it. To this day, at least eight jars of Tropical Island Thunder haunt her pantry.<br><br>In such predicaments, sometimes it makes more sense not to can and instead just to eat the excess produce, freeze it, or, as Jessie has done, shove it in a plastic bag and drop it on your neighbor's doorstep accompanied by a note from the "bell pepper fairy."<br><br>The recipes in Tart and Sweet focus first and foremost on selections that taste best when canned--you won't find any strange green bell pepper repositories here.<br><br>3. INVEST IN THE RIGHT GEAR<br><br>Trying to fish a flat metal lid from a pot of boiling water with a pair of tongs requires the dexterity of your grandma. And you're not your grandma. You're a postmillennial canner who in all likelihood can benefit from using the right tools for the job. But think of it this way--having the right tools makes the job not only more efficient but safer. See page 9 for what gear is a must-have and what you don't need.<br><br>4. KNOW WHAT YOU CAN AND CAN'T TWEAK IN A RECIPE<br><br>Although the USDA recommends never altering a canning recipe--which could create an environment for bacteria to grow--let's be honest, some cooks do it anyway.<br><br>Exhibit A: When Jessie first started canning years ago, she made quarts and quarts of salsa of her own creation that, in hindsight, didn't contain nearly enough acid to ensure that microorganisms were destroyed. Luckily, the salsa turned out fine. But playing fast and loose with acidity levels could have resulted in food poisoning. So while we don't suggest altering any of the canning recipes here, if you must tweak, see page 21 for what you can and absolutely cannot alter.<br><br>5. DON'T SWEAT IT IF A JAR FAILS TO SEAL<br><br>Chances are, it's not your fault. A faulty lid was probably to blame. Just process it again (see page 20 for instructions). Or simply refrigerate it and consume the contents within a year.<br><br>6. YIELDS AREN'T SET IN STONE<br><br>The age, size, and water content of your produce may differ substantially from what we used during the testing phase of each recipe, so your yield may turn out to be more or less than what's given. As a general rule, prepare more canning jars and lids than a recipe calls for, since it's better to be overprepared than to come up short.<br><br>7. YOU COULD CAN ALONE--BUT WHY?<br><br>Canning with friends is the best part of preserving. You get to hang out, laugh, share canning tips and tricks, and eat garden fresh food. And since everyone shares in the food prep and the packing and boiling of jars, the workload is spread around equally. So you can preserve larger volumes quicker . . . and break for cocktails earlier. Is there a better way to spend a Saturday afternoon? Jessie and Kelly submit no. In fact, cocktails and canning are wonderful in combination, since pickles and preserved fruits make the best drink garnishes. In Chapter 9, we show you how to host a killer canning party and offer a selection of yummy cocktail recipes to serve your guests.<br><br>Now, let's get canning!<br><br>What Is Canning? (Prepare Yourself for a Little Canning Science)<br><br>At its essence, home canning is about halting the natural process of deterioration in food. This is done by heating the food to a specific temperature for a specific amount of time to destroy the microorganisms that would otherwise turn to enzymes, bacteria, mold, and yeast if left unpreserved. This is why your canning area, canning utensils and equipment, as well as the food itself, should be as clean as possible so you don't inadvertently introduce more germs to what you're trying to de-germ.<br><br>There are two types of canning: water bath canning--which means jars are placed in a pot of boiling water (a technique referred to as "processing" from here on out)--and pressure canning. Which method you choose depends on the acidity of the food you are canning. High-acid food may be boiled in a water bath or pressure canned, but low-acid food must, must, must be pressure canned. As previously mentioned, the recipes in this book that require heat processing use the water bath canning method.<br><br>What is high- or low-acid food? High-acid food has an acidity level--known as a pH--of 4.6 or lower. The acid it contains is either naturally occurring, like in fruit, or added, like in vinegar. The addition of an acidifying agent such as vinegar provides enough acid to make otherwise low- acid vegetables like asparagus or okra safe for water bath canning--they become pickled. (Plain asparagus and plain okra, on the other hand, must be pressure canned.) For produce such as tomatoes that can straddle the line between high acid and low, lemon (or lime) juice or citric acid is added to ensure there's enough acid present for the food to be processed in a water bath. All fruit (except for figs), fruit spreads, acidified tomatoes (see page 38), pickles, relishes, and chutneys--the mouthwatering deliciousness you'll find within these pages--fall into the high-acid category.<br><br>Low-acid food, on the other hand, refers to food that has a pH of 4.6 or higher. (It's confusing--the lower the acid, the higher the pH; the higher the acid, the lower the pH.) All meats, poultry, seafood, dairy, and plain nonpickled vegetables fall into this category. These foods contain insufficient acid to prevent the growth of bacteria, including the potentially fatal Clostridium botulinum. C. botulinum (botulism) is a particularly scary form of food poisoning because it often has no taste or smell--you won't even know you're eating it until . . . it's too late. Botulinum spores are found on most fresh foods and are perfectly safe to eat. They can only reproduce--that is, become deadly--in an airless, moist, room-temperature, low-acid environment like that inside a sealed canning jar. This is why all low-acid food must be heated to a much higher temperature--240�F--to ensure the food is safe to eat. This temperature can't be reached under normal boiling conditions, so pressure must be added using a pressure canner, a more complicated process we have opted to save for another cookbook.<br><br>HIGH-ACID CANNING</p><h2>Moral Agents: Eight Twentieth-Century American Writers</h2><p><p>A deeply considered and provocative new look at major American writers&#x2014;including Saul Bellow, Norman Mailer, and W.H. Auden&#x2014;Edward Mendelson&#x2019;s <i>Moral Agents</i> is also a work of critical biography in the great tradition of Plutarch, Samuel Johnson, and Emerson. Any important writer, in Mendelson&#x2019;s view, writes in response to an idea of the good life that is inseparable from the life the writer lives.&nbsp;<br><br> Fusing biography and criticism and based on extensive new research, <i>Moral Agents</i> presents challenging new portraits of eight writers&#x2014;novelists, critics, and poets&#x2014;who transformed American literature in the turbulent twentieth century. Eight sharply distinctive individuals&#x2014;inspired, troubled, hugely ambitious&#x2014;who reimagined what it means to be a writer.<br><br> There&#x2019;s Saul Bellow, a novelist determined to rule as a patriarch, who, having been neglected by his father, in turn neglected his son in favor of young writers who presented themselves as his literary heirs. Norman Mailer&#x2019;s extraordinary ambition, suppressed insecurity, and renegade metaphysics muddled the novels through which he hoped to change the world, yet these same qualities endowed him with an uncanny sensitivity and deep sympathy to the pathologies of American life that make him an unequaled political reporter. William Maxwell wrote sad tales of small-town life and surrounded himself with a coterie of worshipful admirers. As a powerful editor at <i>The New Yorker</i>, he exercised an enormous and constraining influence on American fiction that is still felt today.<br><br> Preeminent among the critics is Lionel Trilling, whose <i>Liberal Imagination</i> made him a celebrity sage of the anxiously tranquilized 1950s, even as his calculated image of Olympian reserve masked a deeply conflicted life and contributed to his ultimately despairing worldview. Dwight Macdonald, by contrast, was a haute-WASP anarchist and aesthete driven by an exuberant moral commitment, in a time of cautious mediocrity, to doing the right thing. Alfred Kazin, from a poor Jewish �migr� background, remained an outsider at the center of literary New York, driven both to escape from and do justice to the deepest meanings of his Jewish heritage.<br><br> Perhaps most intriguing are the two poets, W.H. Auden and Frank O&#x2019;Hara. Early in his career, Auden was tempted to don the mantle of the poet as prophet, but after his move from England to America he lived and wrote in a spirit of modesty and charity born out of a deeply idiosyncratic understanding of Christianity. O&#x2019;Hara, tireless partygoer and pioneering curator at MoMA, wrote much of his poetry for private occasions. Its lasting power has proven to be something different from its avant-garde reputation: personal warmth, individuality, rootedness in ancient traditions, and openness to the world.</p></p><p><p><b>Edward Mendelson</b> is the Lionel Trilling&nbsp; Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University and the literary executor of the Estate of W.

Reprint.</p><p>Roy Chapman Andrews was never much of a scholar, and anyone who looked at his high school report card might have foretold an undistinguished future. But, from an early age, Andrews's ambitions lay outside the social norm; an ardent fan of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> and a devoted outdoorsman, Andrews wanted nothing more than to be an adventurer. He got his chance when he talked his way onto the staff of the American Museum of Natural History in 1906, under whose auspices, 15 years later, he was to mount the first of his central Asian expeditions. This decade-long program of exploration took Andrews and his team into the heart of the Gobi, one of the last uncharted regions on earth.<p> Convinced for ideological as much as scientific reasons that humans originated not in Africa but in Asia, Andrews spent much of his time in the field seeking evidence of early man. That search would prove fruitless, for, as biographer Charles Gallenkamp notes, "nary a scrap of genuinely ancient human bone was ever retrieved by the Central Asian Expeditions." What Andrews and his colleagues did find, however, has propelled dozens of scientific missions ever since: huge caches of dinosaur bones at places such as Mongolia's Flaming Cliffs. These fossils helped demonstrate geological connections between Asia and North America, and they added dozens of new species to the paleontological record.</p><p> All the while, Andrews contended with bandits, corrupt officials, invading armies, disease, and other dangers. After finishing Gallenkamp's vigorous book, readers will understand why Andrews should have served as the model for the movie character Indiana Jones--who, if anything, pales by comparison to the real thing. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Spider-Man: The Venom Factor (A Novel)</h2><p>The first in a three-part series chronicling the adventures of Spider-Man follows the superhero as he matches wits with his archnemesis, Venom, and battles one of his deadliest foes, the Hobgoblin. By the author of Spock&#39;s World.</p><p>Diane Duane is the author of a score of novels of science fiction and fantasy, among them the <b>New York Times</b> hardcover bestsellers, <b>Spock's World </b>and <b>Dark Mirror</b>, as well as the very popular <b>Wizard Fantasy </b>series, and a second Spider-Man hardcover novel entitled <b>The Lizard Sanction</b>. She is hard at work on a third Spidey novel, <b>The Octopus Agenda</b>. Duane lives with her husband, Peter Morwood--with whom she has written five novels, including the <b>New York Times</b> bestseller, <b>The Romulan Way</b>--in a beautiful valley in rural Ireland.That a full-color Spider-Man trading card will be bound into the first edition of this mediocre kick-off volume to the Marvel Comics Novels series clarifies just who is considered the target readership for the new line of books based on popular Marvel superheroes. Unfortunately, teens may be put off by Duane's (Spock's World) soap-operatic take on the characters, while nostalgia-crazed baby boomers are likely to find the pacing slow, at least until late in the story. The plot concerns how Spider-Man matches wits with archenemies Venom and Hobgoblin and uses an unnamed alien creature (who has a fondness for eating radioactive material) to try to keep Hobgoblin from destroying New York. The assorted characters' complex histories, drawn from decades' worth of Spider-Man comics, are recapped in chunks of prose that are as stale as Duane's handling of the acting career of Spider-Man's wife, Mary Jane Parker (whose forays into auditions don't reflect the reality of the New York acting scene), or, for that matter, of the requisite juvenile humor (Mary Jane wrinkling her nose at Spider-Man's sweat-soaked suit and suggesting that he create a "summerweight" one). Even so, with his comic books selling at the rate of 200 million a year Spidey clearly has enough fans to make this flawed but still mildly diverting first book in a promised Spider-Man trilogy a big success.

The immense wealth extracted from the Lode spurred the growth of San Francisco, and Virginia City, the hell-raising town that sprang up above the mines, was the inspiration for the TV series &#x201c;Bonanza.&#x201d; Innovations in Comstock mining&#x2014;the use of underground &#x201c;cubes&#x201d; to avoid cave-ins and of elevators to bring ore to the surface&#x2014;was adapted to make possible the modern skyscraper.&nbsp;The boom also accentuated less positive themes in American history. The growth of Virginia City brought ruthless treatment of Native Americans. The risks and expenses of deep mining lent themselves to stock-market manipulations and fraud on a grand scale. To opportunists such as William M. Stewart, a mining lawyer and future U.S. Senator&nbsp;with a tenuous grasp of ethics, the Comstock experience meant that the West belonged to the crafty and the strong.&nbsp;Perhaps the boom&#x2019;s most lasting legacy, however, was the education it gave to a great American writer: Mark Twain. In Virginia City, the young journalist learned the value of plain but salty Western speech and saw how he might use the vivid reality of the frontier in the great books of his future. Full of colorful characters and get-rich-quick schemes, <i>Mile-High Fever</i> brings to light one of the least-known but most pivotal episodes in American history.</p><p></p></p><p><p>DENNIS DRABELLE&nbsp;has written for <i>The Atlantic Monthly, GQ, Film Comment, Civilization, </i>and <i>Smithsonian.</i> He is a contributing editor for <i>The Washington Post Book World</i> and won the National Book Critics Circle's Award (1996) for excellence in reviewing. He lives in Washington, DC.</p><p></p><p>one</p><p>The Perfect Monster</p><p>The Comstock rush began as an outlet for the California gold fields, where too many prospectors were trying to strike it rich at the same time. In 1850, restless 49ers heard that gold had been discovered east of the Sierra Nevada, forty miles from Lake Tahoe, in a part of Utah Territory called Washoe after a local Native American tribe. On reconnoitering, they found deposits in Gold Canyon, a gulch in Sun Mountain (soon to be renamed Mt. Davidson), about five miles from the Carson River.</p><p>The setting was hardly the kind that halts pioneers in their tracks, eliciting cries of "Let&#x2019;s build a town here." The mineralized area wasn&#x2019;t much to look at: dry and drained of most colors other than blue (sky), brown (dirt), and gray (rock). Nor was the weather accommodating: aridity combined with the thin, high- altitude air to deliver hot, piercingly sunny days followed by deeply cold nights, with strong winds sharpening the extremes. Before the region could be mined profitably, its remoteness would have to be overcome and its safety assured from Native Americans, not, as it turned out, the namesake Washoes but the more formidable Paiutes. But such challenges lay in the future. For now, the prospects looked good enough to warrant a gamble: some miners began dividing their time, laboring in the Sierra Nevada foothills during the winter to finance summer forays to Gold Canyon.</p><p>Among the sojourners were two brothers, Hosea and Ethan Allen Grosh, who deserved far better than what life had in store for them. The sons of a Universalist minister in Pennsylvania, the Groshes were</p><p>. . . of medium height, slight in figure, good- looking, fairly well educated, very quick of observation, ready with expedients [i.e., resourceful], gifted (especially Allen) with exceptional powers of original thought, thoroughly honest and honourable, absolutely devoted to each other, industrious, persevering, chaste, sober, and, above all, "filled with that genuine religion of the heart which is the salt of the earth."</p><p>The exemplary young men had gone through a lot simply to reach the West, traveling to Mexico by ship and crossing that country on horse back only to get stranded eighty miles from the Pacific when the fellow handling their transportation ran out of funds. To secure passage to San Francisco, they sold their horses and gear. When they landed in California in August of 1849, Hosea, the younger brother, was suffering from dysentery, and Ethan had to nurse him back to health before they could set out for gold country. The brothers shook off these setbacks and joined other 49ers in California&#x2019;s El Dorado County.</p><p>On a visit to Gold Canyon in 1853, the Groshes spotted a vein of silver. Setting themselves the goal of "get[ting] a couple of hundred dollars together for the purpose of making a careful examination," they based their plans on a fundamental difference between the mining of gold and silver. In the classic scenario, a 49er with a mule, a grubstake, and a few tools would work placer deposits: loose gold that he isolated by using a pan to scoop up sand from a streambed, then giving the pan a flipping motion to separate out lighter detritus from heavier "color," or specks of gold. With luck, he would be able to follow these specks upstream to the mother lode from which they had eroded. Having "located" (put boundaries to) a claim that embraced the lode, he would stake it, record it with the local registrar of claims next time he went to town, start excavating, and give the resulting mine a name. He might also go so far as to build himself a rocker (a wooden trough with ridges on the bottom to capture gold nuggets carried along with the sand and water sluicing through), but even with that extra, the pro cess was what we would now call low- tech.</p><p>Not so the mining of silver. The claiming pro cess was the same, but how you got to that point was quite different. Silver tends to occur in compounds called sulphurets and is often trapped in silicon dioxide, or quartz, which must be broken down before the precious metal can be extracted. Comstock silver generally took the form of silver chloride, appearing as blue- gray rock or blue- black sand, and streams were not in the habit of pointing the way to it. When other prospectors at Gold Canyon uncovered this foreign matter mixed in with the gold they were chipping out of lodes, they dismissed it as that "damned blue stuff," but the Groshes knew better and kept returning to Gold Canyon. On November 3, 1856, they wrote home to announce the discovery of two veins of silver, one of which they rated "a perfect monster."</p><p>What the Groshes didn&#x2019;t realize was that they had stumbled upon only the monster&#x2019;s tip, which lay above and at the edge of a subterranean zone where the foot of Sun Mountain came into contact with strata of uplifted rock. There volcanic forces had forced molten material containing gold and silver up into fissures, where it had slowly cooled and solidified, leaving a broad belt of ore that stretched for two miles, roughly north&#x2013; south, although interspersed with sections of worthless rock called "horses." (The horses were to cause much trouble in Comstock country, by delaying recognition of a basic truth: the ore formed a more or less continuous vein or ledge rather than a cluster of discrete deposits.) But the Groshes were pleased enough with what little they could see. The following summer, counting on funds promised by a cattle- trader in the Carson Valley, they were trying to master the complexities of silver mining when they learned that their would- be benefactor had been murdered.</p><p>They pressed on anyway until, on August 19, 1857, Hosea swung a pick carelessly, puncturing his foot just below the ankle. Ethan applied poultices, but gangrene set in, and two weeks later Hosea was dead. Ethan wrote pitiably to his father:</p><p>In the first burst of my sorrow I complained bitterly. . . . I thought it most hard that he should be called away just as we had fair hopes of realizing what we had labored for so hard for so many years. But when I reflected . . . what a debt of gratitude I owed God in blessing me for so many years with so dear a companion, I became calm and bowed my head in resignation. "O Father, Thy will, not mine, be done."</p><p>Another letter, sent a few days later, shows that despite his strong faith, Ethan was inconsolable: "I feel very lonely, and miss Hosea very much&#x2014; so much that at times I am strongly tempted to abandon everything and leave the country forever, cowardly as such a course would be. But I shall go on. . . . We have, so far, four veins. Three of them promise much."</p><p>In addition to his emotional loss, Ethan was in the hole for the expenses of Hosea&#x2019;s funeral. By the time he&#x2019;d worked enough to pay off the debt, it was late in the year to be trekking back to California. Accompanied by a friend, a young Canadian prospector named Richard M. Bucke (the author of the above tribute to the brothers&#x2019; "exceptional powers," etc.), Ethan set out on November 20. A snowstorm hit as the pair neared Lake Tahoe. Conditions became so dire that they killed and butchered their donkey for food and, when their wet matches fizzled out, lit a fire with the powder flash from their gun. A second storm followed, their gun wouldn&#x2019;t fire anymore, and they sought warmth at night by burrowing into the snow. By day, they staggered along the middle fork of the American River. Bucke wanted to "lie down and die," but Ethan rallied him.</p><p>By December 6, the two men were so weak that they spent a good part of the day on their hands and knees. As Eliot Lord related in his Comstock Mining and Miners, "From daybreak till noon they had crawled less than a mile and their eyes were closing from overmastering faintness, when they heard the bark of a dog and saw a thin wreath of smoke in the air." They were taken in by miners at a camp fittingly called Last Chance. It came too late for Ethan, though: twelve days later, he died. Bucke survived, but at the cost of having one foot and part of the other amputated. He also lost his taste for prospecting. After recovering, he returned to Canada, where he became a distinguished physician, later the superintendent of a mad house, and the source for Lord&#x2019;s account of the 1857 ordeal.</p><p>Despite failing to realize their dream, the Groshes occupy a pivotal spot in Comstock lore. It&#x2019;s not quite right to credit them with discovering the Lode (when Hosea died, they were homing in on a tributary deposit that never amounted to much) but they were the first to recognize that this was primarily silver country, in which a new and more complex kind of mining would be required.</p><p>What happened next marks the difference between sentimental fiction and callous reality. In a novel written by Horatio Alger or Zane Grey, the energetic, loving brothers would have been the ones to put the great silver deposit&#x2014; the Grosh Bonanza, as it might have been called&#x2014; on the map. Instead, the founders were a couple of characters remembered as lowlifes. The first was Henry "Pancake" Comstock, a man so peculiar that he was reputed to be a half- wit (his nickname came from his habit of frying up pancakes because he was in too much of a hurry to bake bread). In fact, however, he seems to have been a scheming blowhard. In January of 1859, he happened upon two placer miners in another cleft in the side of Mt. Davidson, Six Mile Canyon, a mile or so north of Gold Hill, the settlement that had grown up above Gold Canyon. The miners were one party out of many working the area, but Comstock liked what he could see of their chosen terrain. In what was probably a bold- faced lie, he asserted that they were trespassing on property he&#x2019;d already claimed as a "ranch." Unless you mean to raise reptiles, it&#x2019;s hard to imagine a site less suitable for ranching than that barren slope. But the pair couldn&#x2019;t prove him wrong, so they did what might be expected of men who live for luck and aren&#x2019;t looking for trouble: they shrugged and let him in on the action.</p><p>The nascent mine was called the Ophir, after a bountiful gold mine in the Bible, but in an early American example of how the bold shall inherit the earth, the loquacious Comstock made it inseparable from himself. "When visitors came, it was always my mine and my everything," a local newspaperman wrote of Comstock&#x2019;s egotism. By sheer persistence, the loquacious Comstock got his name attached to the whole mining district that sprang up around the claim.</p><p>The other alleged good- for- nothing to make a lasting impression was a prospector named James "Old Virginia" Finney, who named the new town that evolved out of the camp thrown together above Six Mile Canyon. Perched about halfway up the mountainside at 6,200 feet above sea level, the site at first went by the utilitarian handle "Ophir Diggings." According to a story told by Pancake himself, " &#x2018;Old Virginia&#x2019; was out one night with a lot of the &#x2018;boys&#x2019; on a drunk, when he fell down and broke his whisky bottle. On rising he said&#x2014;&#x2018;I baptize this ground Virginia.&#x2019; " With the added "City," this is how the town sitting on top of some of the Comstock Lode&#x2019;s richest ore has been known ever since. (The name "Virginia" also stuck to the mountain range of which Mt. Davidson is the highest peak.)</p><p>Traces of these founding worthies can still be found among the records of the Storey County Court house. (Virginia City became and remains the county seat whereas the more conveniently located Carson City won out as state capital.) Notice Book C consists of loose pages gathered into a binder and protected by plastic sleeves, but the handwritten entries were originally made in a blank book shelved behind a bar. An 1859 notice refers to "the supposed Quartz Vein discovered by Mr. Pancake Comstock &amp; Co.," although in another entry, a deed of sale, the flapjack-lover styles himself "H. Comstock." On October 21, 1859, Finney signed a notice of sale with an X, described as "his mark"; the man was obviously illiterate. A barroom was a handy place to file records&#x2014; too handy, as it turned out. Miners liked to take the book down and fiddle with the boundaries of their claims to reflect what they&#x2019;d learned by following ore deeper underground. That second- guessing contributed to the chaos that provoked an infamous series of Comstock lawsuits.</p><p>With Comstock himself yakking on the sidelines, the gold miners worked their and his claim for several weeks, discarding pieces of gray- blue rock as they went along. (The Groshes had confided their opinion that this was silver- bearing ore to a few friends, but it wasn&#x2019;t general knowledge.) Not until July did the truth come out. A visiting rancher walked off with a chunk of the dark rock, which he passed on as a curiosity to a judge in Placerville, California. The judge took the stone to a local assayer, who put a value of $876 per ton on its gold content, and $3,000 on its silver. Although His Honor meant to keep the find a secret, he couldn&#x2019;t contain himself. Word flew up and down the Sierra foothills: the "damned blue stuff" commingled with the gold being chipped out of Six Mile Canyon wasn&#x2019;t so accursed after all. It was late in the season to be striking out for high country, but a small mob of fortune- hunters reached Gold Hill in time to extract $275,000 worth of gold before winter set in.</p><p>Such a robust number whetted appetites back west, and the following spring the rush resumed in full spate, a lengthy queue of humanity wending its way from California gold country and beyond.</p><p>Writing for Harper&#x2019;s Monthly Magazine, an indefatigable traveler named J. Ross Browne gave an eyewitness report of the tumult in progress:</p><p>An almost continuous string of Washoeites stretched "like a great snake dragging its slow length along" as far as the eye could reach. . . . Irishmen wheeling their blankets, provisions, and mining implements on wheel- barrows; American, French, and German foot passengers, leading their heavily- laden horses, or carrying their packs on their backs, and their picks and shovels slung across their shoulders; Mexicans, driving long trains of pack- mules, and swearing fearfully, as usual, to keep them in order; dapper- looking gentlemen, apparently from San Francisco, mounted on fancy horses; women, in men&#x2019;s clothes, mounted on mules or "burros"; Pike County specimens, seated on piles of furniture and goods in great lumbering wagons; whiskey- peddlers, with their bar-fixtures and whiskey on mule- back, stopping now and then to quench the thirst of the toiling multitude; organ- grinders, carrying their organs; drovers, riding, raving, and tearing away frantically through the brush after droves of self- willed cattle designed for the shambles; in short, every imaginable class, and every possible species of industry, was represented in this moving pageant . . . all stark mad for silver.</p><p>Browne himself had made the trip mostly on foot, walking more than one hundred miles on soupy roads and potholed trails from Placerville to Carson City, where he caught a stagecoach that took him the last few miles to the Comstock. Traveling conditions were so daunting that suppliers could charge outlandishly high prices for their wares. A fellow named Moore got hold of some pack mules and loaded them up with what he thought miners would want. He guessed right: reaching Virginia City on March 31, 1860, he "sold two hundred dollars worth of drinks before nightfall. Forty men paid him a dollar apiece per night for the use of blankets and space enough in his tent to sleep in. Moore refused eight thousand dollars for his goods, which had cost him less than one fifth as much." The men (and some women) kept pouring in, day after day, month after month; two years later, a San Francisco newspaper estimated that nine hundred fifty wagon te...</p></p><h2>UNfinished: Believing Is Only the Beginning</h2><p><p>"<i>Unfinished </i>might just challenge everything you thought you understood about your Christian faith...If every Christian read this book and took it seriously, the world would never be the same again."<br>&#x2015;Bill Hybels, senior pastor Willow Creek Community Church</p><p>"Just when I've gotten comfortable with my faith, here comes Rich Stearns, reminding me what matters and who God loves and why...Just when I dare think my work is done, Rich reminds me that we are just getting started."<br>&#x2015;Max Lucado, pastor and best-selling author</p><p>"More purpose.

This question, as in <b>Birdsong</b>, is at the heart of <b>Human Traces</b>.<br><br>The story begins in Brittany where a young, poor boy somehow passes his medical exams and goes to Paris, where he attends the lectures of Charcot, the Parisian neurologist who set the world on its head in the 1870s.

It was poor country &#x2014; so poor, remarked the Cur�, who had recently arrived from Angers, that the stones of the shore called out for God's mercy. With the mist came sputtering rain, made invisible by the extinguished light, as it exploded like flung gravel at the windows, while stronger gusts made the shivering pine trees shed their needles on the dark, sanded earth.<br><br>Jacques Rebi�re listened to the sounds from outside as he looked through the window of his bedroom; for a moment, a dim moon allowed him to see clouds foaming in the darkness. The weather reminded him, often, that it was not just he, at sixteen years old, who was young, but all mankind: a species that took infant steps on the drifts and faults of the earth.<br><br>Between the ends of his dirtied fingers, Jacques held a small blade which, over the course of several days, he had whetted to surgical sharpness. He pulled a candle closer. From downstairs he could hear the sound of his father's voice in reluctant negotiation.<br><br>The house was at the top of a narrow street that ran off the main square of Sainte Agn�s. Behind it, the village ended and there were thick woods &#x2014; Monsieur Rebi�re's own property &#x2014; where Jacques was meant to trap birds and rabbits and prevent other villagers doing likewise. The garden had an orchard of pear and apple trees whose fruits were collected and set to keep in one of the outbuildings. Rebi�re's was a house of many stores: of sheds with beaten earth underfoot and slatted wooden shelves; of brick-floored cellars with stone bins on which the cobwebs closed the access to the bottles; of barred pantry and latched larder with shelves of nuts and preserved fruits. The keys were on a ring in the pocket of Rebi�re's waistcoat. Although born no more than sixty years earlier, he was known as 'old Rebi�re', perhaps for the arthritic movement of his knees, when he heaved himself up from his chair and straightened the joints beneath his breeches. He preferred to do business standing up; it gave the transaction a temporary air, helping to convince the other party that bargaining time was short.<br><br>Old Rebi�re was a forester who worked as the agent for a landowner from Lorient. Over the years he had done some business on his own account, acquiring some parcels of land, three cottages that the heirs did not want to keep, some fields and woodland. Most of his work was no more than that of bailiff or rent collector, but he liked to try to negotiate private deals with a view to becoming a businessman in his own right. Born in the year after Waterloo, he had lived under a republic, three kings and an emperor; twice mayor of the local town, he had found it made little difference which government was in Paris, since so few edicts devolved from the distant centre to his own Breton world.<br><br>The parlour of the house had smoke-stained wooden panelling and a white stone chimneypiece decorated with the carved head of a wild boar. A small fire was smouldering in the grate as Rebi�re attempted to conclude his meeting with the notary who had come to see him. He never invited guests into his study but preferred to speak to them in this public room, as though he might later need witnesses to what had passed between them. His second wife sat in her accustomed chair by the door, sewing and listening. Rebi�re's tactic was to say as little as possible; he had found that silence, accompanied by pained inhalation, often induced nervousness in the other side. His contributions, when they were unavoidable, were delivered in a reluctant murmur, melancholy, full of a weariness at a world that had obliged him to agree terms so self-wounding.<br><br>'I am not a peasant,' he told his son. 'I am not one of those men you see portrayed at the theatre in Paris, who buries his gold in a sock and never buys a bonnet for his wife. I am a businessman who understands the modern world.'<br><br>From upstairs, Jacques could still hear his father's business murmur. It was true that he was not a peasant, though his parents had been; true too, that he was not the miser of the popular imagination, though partly because the amount of gold he had to hoard was not great enough: forty years of dealing had brought him a modest return, and perhaps, thought Jacques, this was why his father had forbidden him to study any further. From the age of thirteen, he had been set to work, looking after the properties, mending roofs and fences, clearing trees while his father travelled to Quimper and Vannes to cultivate new acquaintances.<br><br>Jacques looked back to his table, not wanting to waste the light of the wax candle he had begged from Tante Mathilde in place of the dingy ox-tallow which was all his father would allow him. He took the blade and began, very carefully, to make a shallow incision in the neck of a frog he had pinned, through its splayed feet, to the untreated wood. He had never attempted the operation before and was anxious not to damage what lay beneath the green skin, moist from the saline in which he had kept it. The frog was on its front, and Jacques's blade travelled smoothly up over the top of its head and stopped between the bulging eyes. He then cut two semicircular flaps to join at the nape of the neck and pushed back the pouches of peeled skin, with their pearls of eyes. Beneath his delicate touch he could see now that there was little in the way of protection for the exposed brain. He took out a magnifying glass.<br><br>What is a frog's fury? he thought, as he gazed at the tiny thinking organ his knife had exposed. It was beautiful. What does it feel for its spawn or its mate or the flash of water over its skin? The brain of an amphibian is a poor thing, the Cur� had warned him; he promised that soon he would acquire the head of a cow from the slaughterhouse, and then they would have a more instructive time. Yet Jacques was happy with his frog's brain. From the side of the table he took two copper wires attached at the other end to a brass rod that ran through a cork which was in turn used to seal a glass bottle coated inside and out with foil.<br><br>'Jacques! Jacques! It's time for dinner. Come to the table!'<br><br>It was Tante Mathilde's voice; clearly Jacques had not heard the notary depart. He set down the electrodes and blew out the candle, then crossed the landing to the top of the almost-vertical wooden staircase and groped his way down by the familiar indentations of the plaster wall. His grandmother came into the parlour carrying a tureen of soup, which she placed on the table. Rebi�re and his wife, known to Jacques as Tante Mathilde, were already sitting down. Rebi�re drummed his knife impatiently on the wood while Grandm�re ladled the soup out with her shaking hand.<br><br>'Take a bowl out to . . .' Rebi�re jerked his head in the direction of the door.<br><br>'Wait,' said Grand-m�re. 'There's some rabbit, too.'<br><br>Rebi�re rolled his eyes with impatience as the old woman went out to the scullery again and returned with a second bowl that she handed to Jacques. He carried both dishes carefully to the door and took a lantern to light his way out into the darkness, watching his feet on the shiny cobbles of the yard. At the stable, he set down the food and pulled back the top half of the door; he peered in by the light of the flame and felt his nostrils fill with a familiar sensation.<br><br>'Olivier? Are you there? I've brought dinner. There's no bread again, but there's soup and some rabbit. Olivier?'<br><br>There was a sudden noise from the horse, like the rumbling clatter of a laden table being overturned, as she shifted in the stall.<br><br>'Olivier? Please. It's raining. Where are you?'<br><br>Wary of the horse, who lashed out with her hind legs if frightened, Jacques freed the bolt of the door himself and made his way into the ripe darkness of the stable.<br><br>Sitting with his back to the wall, his legs spread wide apart on the dung-strewn ground, was his brother.<br><br>'I've brought your dinner. How are you?'<br><br>Jacques squatted down next to him.<br><br>Olivier stared straight ahead, as though unaware that anyone was there. Jacques took his brother's hand and wrapped the fingers round the edge of the soup bowl, noticing what could be smears of excrement on the nails. Olivier moved his head from side to side, thrusting it back hard against the stable wall. He muttered something Jacques could not make out and began to scrape at his inner forearm as if trying to rid himself of a bothersome insect.<br><br>Jacques took a spoonful of the soup and held it up to Olivier's face. Gently, he prised open his lips and pushed the metal inwards. It was too dark to see how much went into his mouth and how much trickled down his tangled beard.<br><br>'They want me to come, they keep telling me. But why should I go, when they know everything already?'<br><br>'Who, Olivier? Who does?'<br><br>Their eyes met. Jacques felt himself summed up and dismissed from Olivier's mental presence.<br><br>'Are you cold? Do you want more blankets?'<br><br>Olivier became earnest.'Yes, yes, that's it, you've got to keep warm, you've to wrap up now the winter's coming. Look. Look at this.' He held up the frayed horse blanket beneath which he slept and examined it closely, as though he had not seen it before or had suddenly been struck by its workmanship.<br><br>Then his vigour was quenched again and his gaze became still.<br><br>Jacques took his hand. 'Listen, Olivier. It's nearly a year now that you've been in here. Do you think you could try again? Why don't you come out for a few minutes? I could help.'<br><br>'They don't want me.'<br><br>'You always say that. But perhaps they'd be happy to have you back in the house.'<br><br>'They won't let me go.'<br><br>Jacques nodded. Olivier was clearly talking of a different 'they', and he was too frightened to contradict or to press him. He had been a child when Olivier, four years the older, started to drift away from his family; it began when, previously a lively and sociable youth, he took to passing the evenings alone in his room studying the Bible and drawing up a chart of 'astral influences'. Jacques was fascinated by the diagrams, which Olivier had done in his clever draughtsman's hand, using pens he had taken from the h�tel de ville, where he worked as a clerk.<br><br>Jacques's experiences had usually come to him first through the descriptions of Olivier, who naturally anticipated all of them. Mathematics at school were a jumble of pointless signs, he said, that made you want to cry out; being beaten by the master's ruler on the knuckles hurt more than being kicked on the shin by the broody mare. Olivier had never been to Paris, but Vannes, he told Jacques, was so huge that you got lost the moment you let your concentration go; and it was full of women who looked at you in a strange way. When changes came to your body, Olivier said, you noticed nothing, no hairs bursting the skin, no wrench in your voice; the only difference was that you felt urgent, tense, all the time, as though about to leap a stream or jump from a high rock.<br><br>Olivier's chart of astral influences therefore looked to Jacques like another early glimpse of a universal human experience granted to him by his elder brother. Olivier had been right about everything else: in Vannes, Jacques kept himself orientated at all times, like a dog sniffing the wind; he liked mathematics, though he saw what Oliver had meant. He avoided the master's beatings.<br><br>'Where is God in this plan?' he had said, pointing with his finger. 'I see the planets and their influence and this character, here, whatever his name is. But in the Bible, it says that&#x2014;'<br><br>'God is here, in your head.And here.' Olivier pointed to the chart. 'But it's a secret.'<br><br>'I don't understand,' said Jacques. 'If this is Earth here, this is Saturn, and here are the rings of Jupiter and this is the body you've discovered, the one that regulates the movements of people, then what are these lines here? Are these the souls of the dead going up to Heaven?'<br><br>'Those are the rays of influence. They emanate from space, far beyond anything we can see. These are what control you.'<br><br>'Rays?'<br><br>'Of course. Like rays of light, or invisible waves of sound. The universe is bombarded with them.You can't hear them.You can't see them.'<br><br>'Does everyone know about them? All grown-ups?'<br><br>'No.'<br><br>'How do you know about them? Who told you?'<br><br>'I have been told.'<br><br>Jacques looked away. Over the weeks, he discovered that Olivier's system of cosmic laws and influences was invulnerably cogent; there was in fact something of the weary sage in his manner when he answered yet another of Jacques's immature questions about it, while its ability to adapt made it impermeable to doubt. Olivier was always right, and his rightness was in the detail. Jacques was not sure that this next phase of his education, these rays and planets into which Olivier was inducting him, was one he welcomed. He believed in what he learned at church and in what the Cur� told him later in their walks through the woods and down to the sea. At least, he thought he did; he believed that he believed.<br><br>'Would you like some of the rabbit? Grand-m�re cooked it.'<br><br>Jacques wanted the company of his brother but shrank from sitting in the fouled straw.<br><br>'Don't you want a bath, Olivier? Would you like to wash?'<br><br>'I take my bath in the sea.'<br><br>'You haven't been to the sea for-'<br><br>'The water runs clear . . . Always clear.'<br><br>'What do you do all day, Olivier? When I go out to work for Papa?'<br><br>He felt Olivier's breath on his cheek. 'That's the trouble with the army. No time to yourself.You're up at six, and it's stand-to at six fifteen. They've sent all my clothes back to Rennes . . . But you shouldn't stand there, that's not your place.'<br><br>Jacques said nothing. He had the feeling that, although there was no one else in the stable, it was not to him that Olivier was addressing his remarks. He became impatient when Jacques tried to break in; he seemed frightened of displeasing the absent person by failing to pay full attention to their shared conversation.<br><br>Olivier grew agitated. 'Don't stand there. That's his place.You're always in the way.Why don't you learn to do what you're told?' He stood up and grabbed a metal bucket from the ground next to the horse's stall. Jacques thought he was going to throw it, but the strength seemed to leave him again, and he dropped the bucket as he slumped back into his original position, with his back to the wall. He was silent, though his limbs were still agitated as he moved his head from side to side.<br><br>Jacques had not lost his brother; he had not woken up one day to find him gone. Rather, Olivier had stolen away, little by little, like smoke beneath the door; and it had happened so slowly that there seemed no moment at which Jacques could have said, 'He's gone.' It was still occasionally possible to talk to him and feel that something was transmitted and received, though more often Olivier's ear seemed tuned to other tones, the commandments of ancestral voices.<br><br>Jacques did not understand what had happened. He wanted to believe in the universe his brother described; he wanted to see the logic or the plan - to share and understand them so that he could have his confidant again: he was lonely without Olivier and he no longer had a guide to what lay ahead of him. Other people of his own age did not interest him; compared to the intimacy he had shared with Olivier, their...</p><h2>Scanorama: Deadly Predators</h2><p>On the pages of <i>Scanorama: Deadly Predators</i>, kids are treated to a virtual X-ray tour featuring some of the world's most dangerous animals.

I teach and do research in atomic physics and quantum optics.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Quantum what?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Quantum optics. Broadly defined, it&#x2019;s the study of the interaction between light and atoms in situations where you have to describe one or both of them using quantum physics.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;That sounds complicated.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It is, but it&#x2019;s fascinating stuff. Quantum physics has all sorts of weird and wonderful properties. Particles behave like waves, and waves behave like particles. Particle properties are indeterminate until you measure them. Empty space is full of &#x2018;virtual particles&#x2019; popping in and out of existence. It&#x2019;s really cool.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Hmmm.&#x201d; She looks thoughtful, then says, &#x201c;One last test.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Rub my belly.&#x201d; She flops over on her back, and I reach down to rub her belly. After a minute of that, she stands up, shakes herself off, and says &#x201c;Okay, you&#x2019;re pretty good. Let&#x2019;s go home.&#x201d; </p><p>We head back to the kennel to fill out the adoption paperwork. As we&#x2019;re walking, she says, &#x201c;Quantum physics, huh? I&#x2019;ll have to learn something about that.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;d be happy to explain it to you sometime.&#x201d; </p><p>Like most dog owners, I spend a lot of time talking to my dog. Most of our conversations are fairly typical&#x2014;don&#x2019;t eat that, don&#x2019;t climb on the furniture, let&#x2019;s go for a walk. Some of our conversations, though, are about quantum physics. </p><p>Why do I talk to my dog about quantum physics? Well, it&#x2019;s what I do for a living: I&#x2019;m a college physics professor. As a result, I spend a lot of time thinking about quantum physics. </p><p>What is quantum physics? Quantum physics is one part of &#x201c;modern physics,&#x201d; meaning physics based on laws discovered after about 1900. Laws and principles of physics that were developed before about 1900 are considered &#x201c;classical&#x201d; physics. </p><p>Classical physics is the physics of everyday objects&#x2014;tennis balls and squeaky toys, stoves and ice cubes, magnets and electrical wiring. Classical laws of motion govern the motion of anything large enough to see with the naked eye. Classical thermodynamics explains the physics of heating and cooling objects, and the operation of engines and refrigerators. Classical electromagnetism explains the behavior of lightbulbs, radios, and magnets. </p><p>Modern physics describes the stranger world that we see when we go beyond the everyday. This world was first revealed in experiments done in the late 1800s and early 1900s, which cannot be explained with classical laws of physics. New fields with different rules needed to be developed. </p><p>Modern physics is divided into two parts, each representing a radical departure from classical rules. One part, relativity, deals with objects that move very fast, or are in the presence of strong gravitational forces. Albert Einstein introduced relativity in 1905, and it&#x2019;s a fascinating subject in its own right, but beyond the scope of this book. </p><p>The other part of modern physics is what I talk to my dog about. Quantum physics or quantum mechanics* is the name given to the part of modern physics dealing with light and things that are very small&#x2014;molecules, single atoms, subatomic particles. Max Planck coined the word &#x201c;quantum&#x201d; in 1900, and Einstein won the Nobel Prize for presenting the first quantum theory of light.&#x2020; The full theory of quantum mechanics was developed over the next thirty years or so. </p><p>The people who made the theory, from early pioneers like Planck and Niels Bohr, who made the first quantum model of the hydrogen atom, to later visionaries like Richard Feynman and Julian Schwinger, who each independently worked out what we now call &#x201c;quantum electrodynamics&#x201d; (QED), are rightly regarded as titans of physics. Some elements of quantum theory have even escaped the realm of physics and captured the popular imagination, like Werner Heisenberg&#x2019;s uncertainty principle, Erwin Schr�dinger&#x2019;s cat paradox, and the parallel universes of Hugh Everett&#x2019;s many-worlds interpretation. </p><p>Modern life would be impossible without quantum mechanics. Without an understanding of the quantum nature of the electron, it would be impossible to make the semiconductor chips that run our computers. Without an understanding of the quantum nature of light and atoms, it would be impossible to make the lasers we use to send messages over fiber-optic communication lines. </p><p>Quantum theory&#x2019;s effect on science goes beyond the merely practical&#x2014;it forces physicists to grapple with issues of philosophy. Quantum physics places limits on what we can know about the universe and the properties of objects in it. Quantum mechanics even changes our understanding of what it means to make a measurement. It requires a complete rethinking of the nature of reality at the most fundamental level. </p><p>Quantum mechanics describes an utterly bizarre world, where nothing is certain and objects don&#x2019;t have definite properties until you measure them. It&#x2019;s a world where distant objects are connected in strange ways, where there are entire universes with different histories right next to our own, and where &#x201c;virtual particles&#x201d; pop in and out of existence in otherwise empty space. </p><p>Quantum physics may sound like the stuff of fantasy fiction, but it&#x2019;s science. The world described in quantum theory is our world, at a microscopic scale.* The strange effects predicted by quantum physics are real, with real consequences and applications. Quantum theory has been tested to an incredible level of precision, making it the most accurately tested theory in the history of scientific theories. Even its strangest predictions have been verified experimentally (as we&#x2019;ll see in chapters 7, 8, and 9). </p><p>So, quantum physics is neat stuff. But what does it have to do with dogs? </p><p>Dogs come to quantum physics in a better position than most humans. They approach the world with fewer preconceptions than humans, and always expect the unexpected. A dog can walk down the same street every day for a year, and it will be a new experience every day. Every rock, every bush, every tree will be sniffed as if it had never been sniffed before. </p><p>If dog treats appeared out of empty space in the middle of a kitchen, a human would freak out, but a dog would take it in stride. Indeed, for most dogs, the spontaneous generation of treats would be vindication&#x2014;they always expect treats to appear at any moment, for no obvious reason. </p><p>Quantum mechanics seems baffling and troubling to humans because it confounds our commonsense expectations about how the world works. Dogs are a much more receptive audience. The everyday world is a strange and marvelous place to a dog, and the predictions of quantum theory are no stranger or more marvelous than, say, the operation of a doorknob.* </p><p>Discussing quantum physics with my dog is useful because it helps me see how to discuss quantum mechanics with humans. Part of learning quantum mechanics is learning to think like a dog. If you can look at the world the way a dog does, as an endless source of surprise and wonder, then quantum mechanics will seem a lot more approachable. </p><p>This book reproduces a series of conversations with my dog about quantum physics. Each conversation is followed by a detailed discussion of the physics involved, aimed at interested human readers. The topics range from ideas many people have heard of, like particle-wave duality (chapter 1) and the uncertainty pr...</p></p><h2>Vineyard Shadows: A Martha&#39;s Vineyard Mystery</h2><p><p>J.W. Jackson abandoned Boston for the tranquil pleasures of Martha's Vineyard, hoping to leave the violence of the big city behind. But when the past comes looking for him in the guise of two brutal thugs, the former cop knows it is time to put down his fishing pole and start opening doors he'd hoped were closed forever. And when the man the hoodlums were searching for -- a face from Jackson's yesterday -- turns up seeking help, J.W. realizes that personal revenge should be the least of his concerns. Because the shadows darkening the island are longer and deadlier than he ever imagined. And if he can't stem the dark tide lapping at the shores of his beloved Vineyard, the new life he loves and everyone in it will be changed forever.</p></p><p><p>Philip R. Craig grew up on a small cattle ranch near Durango, Colorado, before going off to college at Boston University, where he was an All-American fencer. He earned his M.F.A. at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. A recently retired professor of English at Wheelock College in Boston, he and his wife Shirley now live year-round on Martha's Vineyard.</p><p><b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> I got the details by talking with the survivors, since I wasn't at the house when it happened. Instead, I was on the clam-flats in Katama with my son Joshua. When we came home, there was a cop at the head of our driveway and an ambulance was pulling out and heading toward the hospital in Oak Bluffs. I turned into something made of ice. </p><p> The cop recognized my old Land Cruiser and waved us in. I drove fast down our long, sandy driveway. The yard was full of police cars and uniforms. Sergeant Tony D'Agostine met me as I stepped out of the truck. </p><p> I was full of fear. "Stay here," I said to Joshua, and shut the truck's door behind me. </p><p> "There's been some trouble," said Tony. </p><p> "Where's Zee? Where's Diana?!" </p><p> "Take it easy," said Tony, "it's all over." </p><p> "Where are they?!" I pushed him aside, and went toward the house. He followed me, saying something I wasn't hearing. I saw what looked like blood on the grass. Jesus! Cops stood aside as I came through them. </p><p> That was the beginning of it for me. </p><p> The day had started earlier, of course, and had seemed like any other day. School was out, so the pale June people were already on the island, trying to brown up on the beaches before going back to their mainland jobs. Parking places were getting hard to find on the main streets of the Vineyard's towns, and the harbors were beginning to fill with boats. Another summer season was under way. </p><p> That morning, after breakfast, Zee had had a date with Manny Fonseca down at the Rod and Gun Club, where she would practice her pistol shooting under his sharp eye in preparation for an upcoming competition. </p><p> "I'm taking Diana," Zee had said. "She's been on my case for weeks. She wants to watch, and I guess this is as good a time as any." </p><p> Competitive pistol shooting was an odd recreation for Nurse Zee, because she was a healer who basically disapproved of firearms; but, as she had discovered to her surprise and sometimes consternation, she was what Manny called a "natural" with a pistol. Worse yet, she had found that she enjoyed competitive shooting. These facts notwithstanding, she scorned Manny's NRA clich�s about the benefits of gun possession and was ever ill at ease about having a couple firearms of her own, including the custom .45 that she used in competition. </p><p> "Just remember what Shane told Marian," I told her when she got into one of her antifirearms moods. "'A gun is just a tool. It's as good or bad as the person using it.'" </p><p> "It may be a tool for Shane," said Zee, "but for me it's a toy. That makes it even more stupid and immoral." </p><p> "Target shooting isn't stupid or immoral," I said. "It gives you pleasure. Pleasure is good. Ask any hedonist." </p><p> "Guns are dangerous. We'd be better off if no one had any!" </p><p> There were times when I thought that myself, of course. But although I almost never used them, I still kept my father's 30.06 and shotguns in the gun cabinet, along with the old .38 I'd carried when I was a Boston cop. </p><p> "Maybe," I said, "but people do have them. I have them. You have them. They're not going to go away. It's better to know how to use them safely and to enjoy them than to wish there weren't any." </p><p> "I know. But I don't always like it." </p><p> That morning I'd just said, "Well, make sure the girl child has her earplugs and glasses. I don't need a deaf daughter." </p><p> "What's deaf mean, Pa?" Diana the Huntress, who spent a great deal of time looking for food, had asked. </p><p> "It means you can't hear. Like when you put your fingers in your ears. Shooting is very noisy, and the noise can hurt your ears, so you always wear earplugs when you shoot. And you wear shooting glasses in case something hits you in the eye." </p><p> "Oh." Diana had put her fingers in her ears, and smiled up at me. Then she had pointed and said, "Can I have that piece of toast you didn't eat?" </p><p> "Sure." </p><p> I had gone to the tide chart that was taped to the refrigerator. "Well, since you ladies are going shooting, I guess I will go clamming. If I leave right now, the tide will be just right down-harbor." I had looked at my growing son. "You want to come, Josh?" </p><p> "Yes, Pa." </p><p> Joshua liked to do what his folks did. Such a manly little chap. Just like his dad. </p><p> So he and I had collected our gloves and clam baskets and driven to Katama, full of innocence, not knowing how our lives were about to be changed. </p><p> <br> Back at home, Zee packed her shooting gear into the flight bag she used to tote her stuff, washed and stacked the breakfast dishes, and, just before ten, headed out the door with Diana. </p><p> As she reached her little Jeep, she heard a car coming down the driveway. She put the flight bag on the hood of the Jeep and turned, thinking it was me, coming back early for some reason. </p><p> But it wasn't me. It was a black car with tinted windows. Zee didn't recognize it. The car stopped and for a while nothing else happened. Then doors opened and two men got out. They wore slacks and loose summer shirts that hung down over their belts. Dark glasses covered their eyes. One was a normal-sized man. The other one was the size of a large refrigerator. </p><p> Zee stepped forward to meet them. Diana came, too, and took Zee's hand. </p><p> "Can I help you, gentlemen?" </p><p> "I'll bet you can," said the refrigerator. A little wind caught his shirttail and lifted it slightly, giving Zee a brief glimpse of a pistol holstered on his belt. His black glasses seemed to eat her up. </p><p> "We want to see Tom Rimini," said the other man. </p><p> "I'm afraid you've come to the wrong house," said Zee. "I don't know any Tom Rimini." </p><p> "You Mrs. Jackson?" </p><p> She nodded, feeling uneasy. </p><p> "Then we're at the right house. We don't want no trouble, so you better just have him step out." Somehow both of them had gotten very close to her. </p><p> She pulled Diana nearer to her. "I just told you. I don't know anyone named Tom Rimini." </p><p> "That's not what we hear," said the refrigerator. He put out a huge hand and took hold of the collar of her shirt. "Don't get yourself hurt for him. It won't do no good." </p><p> She jerked herself away from him and felt the shirt tear. She was both angry and frightened. "I don't know who you are, but you'd better get back in that car and get out of here right now!" </p><p> "Oh, a feisty one," said the refrigerator. "I like feisty ones, Howie. Nice tits, too." He laughed. </p><p> "This your little girl?" asked Howie. "Come here, dearie." </p><p> He swept Diana up into his arms before Zee knew what he was doing. </p><p> "Ma! Ma!" cried Diana. </p><p> Zee reached for her, but the refrigerator stepped between her and Howie. </p><p> "Ma! Ma!" he said, grinning and spreading his arms. Zee ducked, but he was expecting her move and caught her. "Hold it, Ma." </p><p> But Zee didn't hold it. She stamped her foot on his shin and brought her knee up hard. It was as though he could read her mind. He turned slightly and the knee glanced off his thigh. Then he slapped her across the face and her ears rang. He slapped her again and she felt sickness rise up in her. She twisted in his arms and this time he let her go. She almost fell. </p><p> "Give me my daughter!" </p><p> "Take it easy," said Howie. "And you take it easy, too, Pat. We don't want any trouble, Mrs. Jackson. We just want Tom Rimini. We get him, we go away. Just like that." </p><p> She felt so light-headed that she could hardly stand. "I tell you he isn't here. I've never heard of him." </p><p> "Go look in the house, Pat," said Howie. </p><p> "Keep an eye on Ma," said Pat. "She may jump you when I'm gone." </p><p> "I don't think so," said Howie. He held Diana against his chest with his left hand and dipped his right hand under his shirt. The hand came out, and there was a click, and the hand was holding a knife with a long, thin blade. He laid it on Diana's cheek. "You won't jump me, will you, Mrs. Jackson?" </p><p> She stepped back. "No. Please take the knife away. I'll do whatever you want, but d</p></p><h2>The Mystery of the Menorah ...and the Hebrew Alphabet</h2><p>This book tells about the history of the Menorah, its final resting place, and offers an important prophetic teachin for us today !</p><p></p><h2>Katherine Mansfield: A Secret Life</h2><p>An account of the life of the gifted, beautiful, but strangely secretive writer provides a glimpse of the competitive London literary scene between 1908 and 1923 and of such literary figures as D.H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf</p><p>Claire Tomalin was literary editor of the New Statesman then the Sunday Times before leaving to become a full-time writer. Her first book, The Life and Death of Mary Wollstonecraft, won the Whitbread First Book Award, and she has since written a number of highly acclaimed and bestselling biographies. They include Jane Austen: A Life, The Invisible Woman, a definitive account of Dickens&#39; relationship with the actress Ellen Ternan, which won three major literary awards, and Samuel Pepys: The Unequalled Self was Whitbread Book of the Year in 2002. In the highly acclaimed Charles Dickens: A Life, she presents a full-scale biography of our greatest novelist. She is married to the writer Michael Frayn.British biographer Tomalin (Shelley and Mary Wollstonecraft) here reinterprets the life and career of the great New Zealand-born short story writer and her relationships with family and friends. Writing from a perspective different from that of previous biographers Antony Alpers and Jeffrey Meyers, and allowed to examine letters not available to them, she is less sympathetic than they to John Middleton Murry and more appreciative of D. H. Lawrence's importance to Mansfield. She adds new dimensions to the pictures of Mansfield's connections with her friend Edith Bendall, her "faithful wife" Ida Constance Baker and Virginia Woolf. "None of her sexual relations with men appears to have given her happiness or even satisfaction," and, in her affairs with women, she did "the courting, the letter-writing and the jilting." Tomalin also suggests that Mansfield's many illnesses and perhaps her death, in 1923 at age 34, from TB, were attributable to the gonorrhea she contracted from Floryan Sobieniowski in 1909.

Hampton was a leading citizen of South Carolina before the War, the highest-ranking cavalry leader during the War, fought in a remarkable number of battles from Antietam to Gettysburg to Bentonville, and was South Carolina's Governor and U.S. Senator after the War.</p><p>At the time of his death in 1902, Hampton was hailed as a bridge between the Old South and the New. His life was also one of dramatic contradictions. He was the quintessential slave owner, but he questioned the ethical underpinnings of the "Peculiar Institution" and argued against reopening the African slave trade. He was a prewar spokesperson for national unity, but he became an avid secessionist. He condemned violence and abhorred dueling, but he personally killed more opponents in battle than any other general, Union or Confederate. He kept South Carolina from the effects of Reconstruction, but he then extended more political benefits to African-Americans than any other Democratic governor in the postwar South.</p><p><i>Gentleman and Soldier</i> is the fascinating story of one of the Civil War's most remarkable and interesting generals.</p></p><p>Edward G.

As they guide their great red rig on the "concrete slab" (the highway), they pass various vehicles, including "a bear on rubber" (police car); they stop for "road tar" (coffee) and take directions from the CB until Frank is "checking my eyes for pinholes" (getting sleepy). Day's clear, detailed oil and watercolor illustrations show workers loading and driving all kinds of powerful vehicles through crowded intersections and along country roads in daylight and darkness. Many kids dream of sweeping across the country in a thundering truck, and this book will add a wealth of detail to their games. The power is in the words, and the lingo is defined in clear, beautiful format at the front and back of the book and in boxes on individual pages. Talk about multicultural. <i>Hazel Rochman</i>After decoding diner lingo ( Frank and Ernest ) and baseball banter ( Frank and Ernest Play Ball ), the brown bear and elephant jacks-of-all-trades take on CB jargon in this winning excursion. Hired to make a fruit shipment, they brush up on big-rig slang before getting on the "concrete slab" (highway). A dispatcher gives them apt "handles"--Frank becomes "Furry Face" and Ernest "Nose"--and coaches them through a serious "window washer" of a storm. Day strives for realism in her watercolor illustrations, so that every car and truck is easily recognizable. The ever curious, enthusiastic Frank and Ernest, who dress in flannel shirts and chinos, appear human but for their heads and "hands." Although the setup here is longer than in the previous books and the argot not as smoothly incorporated, the fun remains. Families making long trips are advised to bring this book along; young riders seem likely to enjoy pointing out "thermos bottles" (tanker trucks), "big dogs" (Greyhound buses) and "draggin' wagons" (tow trucks).

She was no princess, whose wedding could change the course of nations, and neither was she a creature of high society, confident that suitors might come knocking on her door, eager to make first impressions with the hope of being remembered as a mutually beneficial option after the Computer did its work at genetic matchmaking. Her parents were neither destitute nor disreputable, but rather quiet citizens of the Empire, and despite their professional accomplishments, they were, by and large, given privacy to continue their work.</p><p>What Helena was, to her very bones, was practical. She gave no thought to her marriage because she knew her parents didn&#x2019;t think she was ready, even though she would shortly come of age and make her debut in society. Amongst other things, this would earn her the privilege of logging into the &#x2013;gnet, the Church and Crown&#x2013;sponsored system&#x2014;colloquially known as the Computer&#x2014;that would read and store her genetic code with utmost confidentiality, unless she chose to make it searchable and request a match.</p><p>Helena was under no illusion that her parents would support any match made that way just because the general public now accepted it as right and proper. Her faith in the Church of the Empire and its Computer was as steady as it had ever been, but her mother had argued early and often that no computer, however well programmed, could understand matters of the heart. Gabriel and Anna Marcus loved each other very dearly and had done so for the entirety of their relationship with near-perfect ignorance of and indifference to their genetic suitability. They would accept no lesser circumstance for their only daughter, as long as they had any say in the matter&#x2014;which, Helena being as loyal as she was practical, they did.</p><p>So, Helena held herself somewhat aloof from the simmering excitement of New London&#x2019;s impending debut season. The small cohort of the sons and daughters of dons from the University Hospital where her father taught were lively and interesting, and she looked forward to dancing with them at their debut ball, but she had no particular attachment to any of them. None of them had ever made her pulse quicken. She did not save magazine articles about what colour gown complemented her particular white complexion. She did not think of DNA and a church nave decked in flowers. She did not daydream of rumpled sheets and lazy mornings. She did not make plans for a household in New London and how she might run it differently than her parents ran theirs.</p><p>She did, on occasion, let her thoughts linger on August Callaghan, who almost certainly loved her.</p><p>He had not said as much, of course. It had never seemed quite necessary to name aloud what they felt for each other.</p><p>Helena had not seen August in months, not since the previous Thanksgiving, when she and her parents had last been up at their cottage on Lake Muskoka. Helena and August might have had a summer friendship only&#x2014;as so many cottagers&#x2019; children did&#x2014;but their parents were also friendly, and when August&#x2019;s father had business in New London, it was with the Marcuses that he stayed, strengthening the bond between the two families.</p><p>Strengthened into what, Helena was not exactly sure, but August seemed to know, and she was willing to wait until he spoke before she clarified her own feelings. She was very fond of him, and the futures she allowed herself to imagine as his wife were always good ones. She thought that if she were patient, her parents might see that as a sign of maturity and be less likely to quash any proposal, simply because it was the first she received. She would be careful and deliberate with her debut season, avoid the glamour and giddiness as much as she could, and then, when it was all over, and she was legally an adult by the standards of the Empire, she would talk to her parents about August, and to August about the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Margaret</b> missed her sisters but, aside from that, had no regrets about her decision. She was sure that Anne and Katherine were still moping, but she had promised to write to them and recount every detail of her summer, and that had given her some peace. Well, also their father had planned an extended trip to Scotland for the girls to distract them from the fact that their parents and oldest sister had left them behind. Margaret expected they would have more fun there in any case, as both of them were too young to really enjoy the sort of parties, dinners, teas, and galas her own summer was sure to consist of. It was the right sort of freedom for an eighteen-year-old, but not at all for those at twelve and ten.</p><p>She ran her fingers through her hair, or tried to, anyway. They got stuck in the curly dark mass almost immediately, but that was a sort of freedom, too. At home, her hair was usually straightened and then twisted neatly behind her head. If she had an appearance to make, her hair was tucked away entirely, so that she could wear the traditional wig.</p><p>&#x201c;We are not ashamed of it,&#x201d; her mother would say, her own wig so much a feature on her head that Margaret was hard pressed to recall what her mother&#x2019;s hair actually looked like. Mother and daughter were similar in appearance&#x2014;brown skin, epicanthal fold, freckles that could not be concealed without an unseemly amount of foundation&#x2014;and so their hair was probably similar, too. &#x201c;It is only important that we look neat and contained.&#x201d;</p><p>Her father, who felt his straight hair and white face precluded him from such discussions, never said anything, though Margaret could guess that he didn&#x2019;t like that his wife and daughters still felt they had to conceal their appearance. It had been with his encouragement that Margaret wore her natural hair on this excursion. She had suggested it a bit hesitantly, unsure of the reaction, but her mother had quickly warmed to the idea as well. No one, her mother pointed out, had ever seen her like this. There were no photographs, no records anywhere. Generations of tradition&#x2014;and the unrelenting attendance of the Windsor Guard&#x2014;effectively kept photographers at bay where royal privacy was concerned. It was hoped that anyone who thought her face looked slightly familiar would see the halo of her hair and understated dress and dismiss their suspicions, cleverly turning misconception to personal advantage. Margaret&#x2019;s security detail was not happy, but there wasn&#x2019;t anything they could do besides make their preparations.</p><p>Margaret&#x2019;s own preparations had been no less intense. She had studied the families of the Toronto social scene as well as those from Cornwall, which was where she was pretending to be from, constructing an identity to go along with her disguise. She had also toyed with the idea of modifying the way she spoke, but realized that would be a great deal of effort considering that most Canadians couldn&#x2019;t geographically source British accents the way she could.</p><p>And, of course, there was the corset.</p><p>&#x201c;Your posture is better, if nothing else,&#x201d; the Archbishop had said as he sipped the tea that Margaret poured for him. He had made no attempt at all to conceal his amusement as he watched her practice.</p><p>&#x201c;I can feel my kidneys blending,&#x201d; she had replied, still holding the pose&#x2014;though, to be perfectly honest, it wasn&#x2019;t that bad.</p><p>Modern corsets were designed to have all the style of antiquity, but fewer of the medical shortcomings; and Margaret&#x2019;s was as high-tech as they came. The programmable threads used to stitch the seams would loosen her laces if she became short of breath, and the flexible material allowed her to sit with only minor discomfort. She couldn&#x2019;t run a marathon in it, but she could eat and dance and sit for tea without any problems.</p><p>That said, she was happy not to be wearing one now. The train was comfortable enough, but she was stiff from sitting, and a corset would only make that worse. There would be plenty of time for all of that sort of thing when she arrived in Toronto and the debut festivities began.</p><p>Outside her window, the Canadian landscape sped by: green and beautiful and, someday, <i>hers</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>August</b> looked at the column of numbers and sighed. He was going to get caught. It was only a matter of time. And his family&#x2014;one of the most prominent Irish&#x2013;Hong Kong Chinese lineages in Canada&#x2014;would be put at risk. Still, he could use what little manoeuvrability he had to cover for the family and company, even if there was no way he could see to save himself. Ever since he had come of age and his father entrusted to his oversight the shipping portions of the family enterprise, he had been determined to prove worthy of his father&#x2019;s confidence. Now August was in over his head and he had no idea who he could turn to.</p><p>It had begun simply enough, as he suspected these things always did. Callaghan lumber ships in the Great Lakes had fallen prey to pirates, though the fleet did not stray from Canadian territorial waters, and August had no idea how to protect them. And protecting them was <i>his </i>job, a job his father had given to him in a moment of pride and confidence it now pained August to recall.</p><p>Nearing his wit&#x2019;s end at a meeting in Toronto, he had encountered a woman who promised him she could guarantee his ships&#x2019; protection, for a fee. That was when his stupidity overcame him. He paid her, gladly. The woman was a pirate herself, of course, sailing under the familiar banner of a band of privateers that called Port Cleaveland home. And she did protect his ships, using her corsairs to harry anyone who might have thought him a good target. Only after it was too late did he realize that she had probably been attacking him herself before he started paying her, and if he stopped, she would certainly resume.</p><p>It was a neat trap, and he was stuck in it. The payments were still manageable, at least. He had set it up so that a portion of his own wage went into a &#x201c;discretionary fund.&#x201d; The last thing he wanted to do was implicate the entire family in his descent. If anyone noticed, they would think he was only establishing his own investments, a clever move for a young man who had inherited everything, if he wanted to prove himself.</p><p>But August knew. He was ashamed of it and he had no idea how he would extricate himself from the situation. And extricate himself he must&#x2014;not simply to preserve family honour and his father&#x2019;s good opinion, but because this was the summer that Helena Marcus would come of age, and the summer when, at last, they could talk seriously about their intent to marry. He couldn&#x2019;t bring her into this. He wouldn&#x2019;t. It wasn&#x2019;t safe, for starters, and it was also illegal.</p><p>He deleted the spreadsheet file from his data pad and put it down on his desk, harder than was necessary. He wanted to put his head in his hands and moan, but that would attract the attention of his sister or his valet, and he wasn&#x2019;t sure which of the two would be worse. He had to go and pack. He was already behind schedule, and if anyone asked him why, he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to give an answer. He took several deep breaths, the way his mother had done before she scolded him when he was a child, and forced his anxiety to the side. He had to be under control, and he would be. Too many people relied on him for it to be otherwise.</p><p>For all of his twenty years, August Callaghan had been told that he had everything, and now, just when his bright future should be dawning, he stood to lose it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Victoria-Elizabeth,</b> Queen of England and ruler of an Empire on which the sun never set, made sure her wig was properly anchored, took her husband&#x2019;s proffered arm, and made her exit from the train.</p></p><h2>But No Elephants</h2><p>Grandma Tildy lived all alone, until a salesman stopped by to sell her a pet.

The book describes in detail the meals the kitchen staff had to prepare, and includes a section on preserving and a list of recipes.</p><p>If you've ever wondered how downstairs provided upstairs with all of those elaborate meals, wonder no more. Davies, a BBC producer, has written a meticulously detailed work about the nerve center of the Victorian home--the kitchen. Be warned: this is not a cookbook so much as book about cooking, although some recipes are included. The author explains how the kitchen functioned in an era when industry was expanding but stoves still had to be lit by hand at six o'clock in the morning. Chapters examine the relationship between mistress and servants, the social hierarchy of the kitchen and the sometimes Dickensian conditions under which kitchen maids and cooks had to work to yield the expected bounty. The book is filled with period illustrations and photos from the BBC series of the same name, and includes vivid anecdotes from veterans of Victorian staffs. The few recipes featured are drawn straight from Victorian sources. They have been modernized, but read carefully before trying them. If you do attempt them,, you'll produce a reasonable facsimile of a Victorian dinner--typically, with mulligatawny soup, boiled leg of mutton, potato snow and treacle pudding. Still, after you've made all of these things by hand, you may want to give your microwave a hug. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Phantom Stallion #7: Desert Dancer</h2><p><p><strong>As Samantha adjusts to having a new step&#x2013;mother, she must help the Phantom find his missing lead mare.

A dream to become an actress, like her idols Ron Howard and Vicki Lawrence. But it was a long way from the South Side of Chicago to Hollywood, and it didn&#x2019;t help that she&#x2019;d recently dropped out of the school play, <i>The Ugly Duckling</i>. Or that the Hollywood casting directors she wrote to replied that &#x201c;professional training was a requirement.&#x201d; <br><br>But the funny thing is, it all came true. Through a series of happy accidents, Jane Lynch created an improbable&#x2014;and hilarious&#x2014;path to success. In those early years, despite her dreams, she was also consumed with anxiety, feeling out of place in both her body and her family. To deal with her worries about her sexuality, she escaped in positive ways&#x2014;such as joining a high school chorus not unlike the one in <i>Glee</i>&#x2014;but also found destructive outlets. She started drinking almost every night her freshman year of high school and developed a mean and judgmental streak that turned her into a real-life Sue Sylvester.<br><br>Then, at thirty-one, she started to get her life together. She was finally able to embrace her sexuality, come out to her parents, and quit drinking for good. Soon after, a Frosted Flakes commercial and a chance meeting in a coffee shop led to a role in the Christopher Guest movie Best in Show, which helped her get cast in The <i>40-Year-Old Virgin</i>. Similar coincidences and chance meetings led to roles in movies starring Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd, and even Meryl Streep in 2009&#x2019;s <i>Julie &amp; Julia</i>. Then, of course, came the two lucky accidents that truly changed her life. Getting lost in a hotel led to an introduction to her future wife, Lara. Then, a series she&#x2019;d signed up for abruptly got canceled, making it possible for her to take the role of Sue Sylvester <i>in Glee</i>, which made her a megastar. <br><br>Today, Jane Lynch has finally found the contentment she thought she&#x2019;d never have. Part comic memoir and part inspirational narrative, this is a book equally for the rabid <i>Glee</i> fan and for anyone who needs a new perspective on life, love, and success.<br><br>WITH A FOREWORD BY CAROL BURNETT<br><b>Excerpt from <i>Happy Accidents</i>:</b><br><br>If I could go back in time and talk to my twenty-year-old self, the first thing I would say is: &#x201c;Lose the perm.&#x201d; Secondly I would say: &#x201c;Relax.

I wanted to belong and feel like I was valued and seen. Well, now I am a working actor, and I guarantee you it&#x2019;s not because I suffered or worried over it. <br><br>As I look back, the road to where I am today has been a series of happy accidents I was either smart or stupid enough to take advantage of. I thought I had to have a plan, a strategy. Turns out I just had to be ready and willing to take chances, look at what&#x2019;s right in front of me, and put my heart into everything I do. All that anxiety and fear didn&#x2019;t help, nor did it fuel anything useful. My final piece of advice to twenty-year-old me: Be easy on your sweet self.

In every period of our history, people of faith have envisioned a society of peace and justice, and their tireless efforts have made an indelible mark on our nation&#x2019;s history.<br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>Prophetic Encounters</i>, Dan McKanan challenges simple distinctions between &#x201c;religious&#x201d; and &#x201c;secular&#x201d; activism, showing that religious beliefs and practices have been integral to every movement promoting liberty, equality, and solidarity. From Frederick Douglass, John Brown, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton in the nineteenth century to Dorothy Day, Martin Luther King Jr., and Starhawk in the twentieth, American radicals have maintained a deep faith in the human capacity to transform the world. This radical faith has always been intertwined with the religious practices of Christians and Jews, pagans and Buddhists, orthodox believers and humanist heretics. Their vision and energies powered the social movements that have defined America&#x2019;s progress: the abolition of slavery, feminism, the New Deal, civil rights, and others.<br>&nbsp;<br>In this groundbreaking, definitive work, McKanan treats the histories of religion and the Left as a single history, showing that American radicalism is a continuous tradition rather than a collection of disparate movements. Emphasizing the power of encounter&#x2014;encounters between whites and former slaves, between the middle classes and the immigrant masses, and among activists themselves&#x2014;McKanan shows that the coming together of people of different perspectives and beliefs has been transformative for centuries, uniting those whose faith is a source of activist commitment with those whose activism is a source of faith.<br>&nbsp;<br>Offering a history of the diverse religious dimensions of radical movements from the American Revolution to the present day, <i>Prophetic Encounters</i> invites contemporary activists to stand proudly in a tradition of prophetic power.<br><br></p></p><p><b>Dan McKanan</b> is the Ralph Waldo Emerson Unitarian Universalist Association Senior Lecturer at Harvard Divinity School and the author of <i>Identifying the Image of God</i>, <i>Touching the World</i>, and <i>The Catholic Worker after Dorothy</i>. His writing has appeared in <i>Sojourners</i>, <i>America</i>, and many other journals.<b>From the Introduction</b><br><br>Everyone needs a history, especially those who seek to change the fu�ture. When radical activists confront the entrenched legacy of racism and sexism in both our institutions and our textbooks, we are tempted to imagine that all history supports the status quo. In an era in which prominent representatives of American Christianity are outspoken in their support of reactionary politics, it is easy to imagine that the history of religion is doubly conservative. But there have always been Ameri�can radicals&#x2014;and those radicals have always drawn strength from their diverse faiths, Christian and Jewish, pagan and Buddhist, orthodox and humanist. To forget our predecessors&#x2019; work is not only to risk repeat�ing their mistakes, it is to lose their wisdom and inspiration. And so, as we organize our neighborhoods or march on Washington, we must tell the stories of the cloud of witnesses who came before us. To encounter them is to discover the human sources of radical faith. <br>&nbsp;<br>On August 11, 1841, Frederick Douglass made his first public speech at a convention in Nantucket. The prospect of addressing white people, Douglass would later recall, was &#x201c;a severe cross&#x201d; because he still &#x201c;felt myself a slave.&#x201d; Yet the act of speaking proved to be liberating for Doug-lass and revelatory for his audience. &#x201c;I spoke but a few moments,&#x201d; Douglass wrote in his autobiography, &#x201c;when I felt a degree of freedom.&#x201d; The antislavery editor William Lloyd Garrison, for his part, reported that &#x201c;I think I never hated slavery so intensely as at that moment. Certainly, my perception of the enormous outrage which is inflicted by it, on the godlike nature of its victims, was rendered far more clear than ever.&#x201d; For both men, their meeting was an encounter with the divine, and they retained a sense of its religious power long after their personal paths diverged. Thirty years later, Douglass mused that it was only through his encounters with other radicals that he could &#x201c;get any glimpses of God anywhere.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Echoes of this sentiment can be heard in every American move�ment for social transformation. A century after Garrison met Douglass, a radical journalist named Dorothy Day found herself longing to en�counter the &#x201c;poor and oppressed&#x201d; immigrants, whom she regarded as &#x201c;collectively the new Messiah.&#x201d; Noticing that most immigrants were Roman Catholics, she joined the church, but soon missed the militant idealism of her socialist past. Why, she wondered, could not Catholi�cism also gather &#x201c;bands of men and women together&#x201d; for social change? Day launched a national network of farms and households where pious Catholics, committed radicals, and the desperately poor encountered one another as they fed the hungry, comforted the afflicted, and afflicted the comfortable.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>A similar hunger for encounter brought several feminists together in a California storefront in the 1970s. They had already had their con�sciousness raised, but they yearned to tap more deeply into the woman-power that, they believed, had inspired ancient worship of the goddess and the medieval healing practices that were stigmatized as witchcraft. Their conversation about magic became a ritual, as the women &#x201c;took hands, and started breathing together.&#x201d; Realizing that &#x201c;a circle had been cast,&#x201d; they anointed themselves, kissed, and began chanting the names of ancient goddesses, entreating them to &#x201c;pour out your light and your ra�diance upon us. . . . Shine! Shine! Shine!&#x201d; As the energy subsided, they chose a coven name, Compost, thus reassuring themselves that &#x201c;what�ever magic brings, it will not take away our ability to laugh at ourselves.&#x201d; They also realized that magic could empower them to change the world. Coven leader Starhawk introduced their Spiral Dance at a massive dem�onstration against a nuclear power plant, and soon pagan-inspired rituals were an integral part of direct action campaigns against war, environ�mental destruction, and globalization.3 <br>&nbsp;<br>The empowering encounters of William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, Dorothy Day, and Starhawk stand in a tradition that has gone by many names. Some would call it the path of the prophets. Others speak of the &#x201c;American radical tradition&#x201d; or simply &#x201c;the Left.&#x201d; It is the tradition of abolitionists who called on their neighbors to immediately renounce the sin of slavery, of feminists who recognized patriarchy as itself a form of slavery, of socialists who labored to build a &#x201c;cooperative commonwealth,&#x201d; and of pacifists who saw war as the ultimate affront to humanity. <br>&nbsp;<br>What holds this tradition together is the experience I have tried to encapsulate in my opening vignettes. When human beings encoun�ter one another deeply, in the midst of their struggles for freedom and equality and community, prophetic power is unleashed. This is power to denounce, to condemn those who would &#x201c;grind the faces of the poor into the dust,&#x201d; in the words of Isaiah. It is also power to <i>announce</i>&#x2014;to proclaim God&#x2019;s Kingdom that will be realized here on earth, the beloved community of black and white and brown together, the new society within the shell of the old. Prophetic power enables people to speak boldly in the face of brickbats and bludgeons and fire hoses. It empow�ers them to tell new stories and build new communities. Because in�terpersonal encounters are the source of this power, their place within radicalism is analogous to the role of divine revelation within traditional Christianity, Judaism, or Islam. For this reason, I describe them as <i>pro�phetic</i> encounters. <br>&nbsp;<br>By placing prophetic encounters at the heart of my story, I hope to share three guiding insights about the American radical tradition. First of all, it <i>is </i>a tradition. Too often we remember abolitionism or feminism or socialism as self-contained &#x201c;movements&#x201d; that emerged in response to particular social problems and disappeared when those problems were overcome or changed form. Such memories obscure the way in which activists of each generation have built alliances and drawn inspiration, religious convictions, and strategies from those who have gone before. Garrison and Douglass were as eloquent in denouncing the sin of sexism as the sin of slavery, and they helped to inspire the pacifists and social�ists of their day. They also pioneered activist tactics that have lasted for centuries. Garrison used his imprisonment for libeling a slave trader to raise awareness of his cause, while Douglass repeatedly refused to leave segregated railway cars until he was expelled by force; Dorothy Day and Starhawk were among the thousands who followed in their footsteps, facing arrest for refusing to participate in civil defense drills or for dis�rupting the 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle. One scarcely needs seven degrees of separation to trace the personal con�nections among the four: Garrison&#x2019;s grandson was among the founders of the pacifist Fellowship of Reconciliation, which worked with the Catholic Worker movement to sponsor the civil defense protests and Vietnam-era draft-card burnings; the first man to go to prison for draft-card burning would later marry Starhawk. Though the Left has not al�ways been one big happy family, even in its divisions and rancor it has been a family. <br>&nbsp;<br>Second, religious ideas, institutions, and practices have always been intertwined with radical activism. American radicals drew inspiration from religious communities as diverse as Frederick Douglass&#x2019;s African Methodist Episcopal Church, Dorothy Day&#x2019;s Roman Catholicism, and Starhawk&#x2019;s neopaganism. It is common nowadays to speak of a &#x201c;reli�gious Left&#x201d; that is distinct from secular radicalism, or to suggest that the prophetic tradition possesses a wisdom lacking in both the &#x201c;religious Right&#x201d; and the &#x201c;secular Left.&#x201d; Such formulations fail to do justice to the spirituality of even the most seemingly &#x201c;unchurched&#x201d; radicals. Many of the most bitter critics of the churches have been people of deep per�sonal faith, inspired by the example of Jesus driving the moneychang�ers from the temple, while those who have tried to separate radical causes from religious language have often hoped to make room for per�sons of divergent theologies. Though Dorothy Day&#x2019;s orthodox Catholic piety was far removed from the dogmatic materialism of the Communist Party, it is not possible to draw a line that neatly separates religious from secular radicals. <br>&nbsp;<br>Indeed&#x2014;and this is my third guiding insight&#x2014;leftist activism is al�most a form of religion. It occupies much of the same psychological and sociological space. People are drawn to religious communities and radical organizations in order to connect their daily routines to a more transcendent vision of heaven, salvation, or a new society. Both religion and radicalism offer individuals powerful new identities&#x2014;as &#x201c;children of God&#x201d; or &#x201c;class-conscious workers&#x201d; or &#x201c;New Negros.&#x201d; In order to extend this power, radicals build organizations&#x2014;social reform societies, utopian communities, third parties&#x2014;that have many churchlike quali�ties. Radicals come together to sing hymns and hear sermons, often gathering on Sunday morning; they articulate their defining beliefs and excommunicate those who dissent; their marches are like pilgrimages and their &#x201c;line-crossing&#x201d; in civil disobedience like a ritual of initiation. Radicalism is more like a religion than like mainstream political tradi�tions, which suspend questions of transcendence in order to reconcile competing interests and build electorally viable coalitions. <br><br>To say that radicalism is almost a form of religion is not to deny the tension between the two but to explain it. Radicals seek to live in rela�tion to a better world that might exist here on earth in the future; most conventionally religious people orient their lives to realities beyond this world. While radicals achieve empowered identities through interper�sonal encounters, most religions offer a new identity through encoun�<br>ter with spiritual beings. (The major exception, religious humanism, has rarely clashed with the Left.) As a result, the relationship between the Left and conventional religiosity has the volatility of sibling rivalry. Some radicals find their religious and radical commitments to be mutu�ally reinforcing; others come to see their cause as the true church. Many American leftists have, from time to time, found themselves in both of these postures. The tensions run deep and should not be dismissed as a matter of secularist prejudice. <br>&nbsp;<br>I will return to these three guiding insights&#x2014;the Left is a tradi�tion, the Left is thoroughly intertwined with religion, the Left is it�self analogous to religion&#x2014;throughout this book. Before entering into my narrative, it may be helpful to define some terms. I use &#x201c;Left&#x201d; and &#x201c;radicalism&#x201d; interchangeably to designate a tradition of social move�ments and organizations that seek to extend the values of liberty, equal�ity, solidarity, and peace. These values are rooted in the American and French revolutions of the late eighteenth century, and American radi�calism in particular is defined by its twofold relationship to the heritage of 1776. On the one hand, American radicals place themselves in the legacy of the Revolution. Taking pride in America, they imitate the rhet�oric of the Declaration of Independence and hope to persuade all Americans to join their cause. On the other hand, American leftists are radically dissatisfied with the Revolution&#x2019;s institutional heritage. They refuse to believe that American structures of political democracy will inevitably lead to greater liberty, equality, and solidarity. And they refuse to worry that present agitation will undermine past gains. American rad�icalism has included movements to end slavery; to include people of all races, genders, and sexualities fully in the national community; to build a cooperative or socialist economy; and to limit or end war and violence. <br><br>American radicalism as I have defined it excludes incremental forms of progressivism that are more concerned with <i>preserving </i>the institu�tions of the Revolution than with <i>extending </i>its values; my definition ex�cludes as well as separatist movements that renounce American ideals. Neither Abraham Lincoln nor Franklin Delano Roosevelt, neither Mar�cus Garvey nor Elijah Muhammad were truly American radicals by my definition, though Garvey and Muhammad were radicals of another stripe. This is not to suggest that true leftists must hold themselves aloof from such people. The Left has learned from Garvey&#x2019;s and Muhammad&#x2019;s passionate devotion to their people, and it has often embraced tactical separatism as a way of empowering people for sustained struggle. Simi�larly, the Left&#x2019;s critique of institutions does not preclude fruitful dialogue with persons who support those institutions. True radicals have never been comfortable within the two-party system of American politics, but some have worked to nudge the parties to more radical ground. Others have cheered from the sidelines when men like Lincoln and Roosevelt embraced elements of their agenda. <br>&nbsp;<br>In arguing that American radicalism constitutes a sustained tradition with a two-hundred-year history, I do not mean to suggest that it is sealed off from other traditions. Radicalism has always had transatlantic and global dimensions, though limitations of space preclude more than glancing acknowledgment of those. American radicals were inspired by the European revolutions of 1830, 1848, and 1917, and by the global anticolonialism of the 1950s and 1960s, just as partisans of those causes drew strength from the &#x201c;spirit of 1776.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Similarly, radicals hold multiple allegiances&#x2014;to specific religious traditions, to their crafts or professions, to their ethnic communities. To say that Dorothy Day was part of the radical tradition, heir to the legacy of Garrison and Douglass, is not to deny that she was also part of the Catholic tradition and heir to the legacy of Thomas Aquinas and Th�r�se of Lisieux. Unlike Catholicism, radicalism has lacked a continu�ous institutional framework to help preserve a consciousness of tradition. As a result, it is easy to imagine that Catholicism was the <i>only </i>tradi�tion that shaped Day&#x2019;s activism in a profound way, or that the black church was the only tradition informing Martin Luther King Jr. My task is to correct this impression by tracing the contours of the tradition all radicals shared, not to diminish the contributions of other traditions. <br>&nbsp;<br>My view of the Left as a tradition does not deny the presence of deep divisions among radicals. Radicals have maintained a sense of shared identity in part by arguing about the best way to promote liberty, equal�ity, and solidarity. Pacifists and revolutionaries repeatedly squared off over the question of whether nonviolent suffering or holy violence was the best way to change institutions. When anarchists and Marxists split over the role of the state in bringing about a cooperative common�wealth, they echoed a nineteenth-century debate between nonvoting Garrisonians who believed that the U.S. Constitution was inherently proslavery and Liberty Party members who countered that its antislavery potential needed only to be unleashed. Other radical debates focused on the value of small-scale utopian experiments, the meri...</p><h2>Rough Justice</h2><p>Mallt-y-Nos. Matilda of the Hunt.

As a former Buddhist monk, he has trained extensively in meditation all over the world for more than 15 years. He returned to the UK in 2004 and set up the Headspace organization with one simple aim in mind: to demystify meditation and make it accessible and relevant to as many people as possible.</p>The Approach <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Meditation and thoughts <br>When I set off for my very first monastery, I was convinced that meditation was all about stopping thoughts. I&#x2019;d heard about this &#x201c;quiet empty mind,&#x201d; which could supposedly be achieved through meditation, and I was desperate to taste it. Sure, I&#x2019;d had a glimpse or two over the years, but I imagined it as something never-ending, a bubble in which there was nothing but space, and through which nothing unpleasant could enter. I imagined it as a place that was free from thoughts and feelings. I&#x2019;m not sure how I ever imagined it was possible to live without thoughts or feelings, but this is how I approached meditation from the beginning. But trying to create this bubble, to achieve this state of mind which I&#x2019;d assumed I needed to reach to be meditating &#x201c;properly,&#x201d; is probably one of the most common misconceptions about meditation. <br>I received some excellent instruction during this time, but the style in which it was delivered only served to reinforce many of the erroneous ideas I had about it. Each day I&#x2019;d visit the teacher and explain how my meditation was going, and how there were all these thoughts racing through my mind that I couldn&#x2019;t stop no matter what I tried. And each day he&#x2019;d tell me to be more vigilant, to try harder to catch the thoughts the moment they arose in the mind. In no time I became a nervous wreck. I&#x2019;d sit &#x201c;on guard&#x201d; hour after hour. It felt like the mental equivalent of the &#x201c;whack-a-mole&#x201d; game you find in a fairground, constantly waiting for the next thought to arrive so that I could jump on it and extinguish it. <br>With eighteen hours of meditation every day and just three hours or so for sleep, it wasn&#x2019;t long before I&#x2019;d exhausted myself completely. I&#x2019;d sit there in the temple straining to achieve something. Anything. But with every extra ounce of effort I moved further away from that which I was seeking. The other monks from the local area looked perfectly relaxed. In fact, there were a few who seemed to regularly nod off. Now while that&#x2019;s obviously not the purpose of meditation, when you&#x2019;re forcing it as much as I was, the idea of sleep was positively dreamy. <br>After a little while my teacher realized that I was putting in too much effort and instructed me to try less. But by this stage I was putting too much effort into everything. Even into trying less. This struggle went on for some time until I was fortunate enough to meet a teacher who seemed to have a natural gift for story-telling, for explaining things in a way I could easily understand. What he said to me came as quite a shock, because his description of meditation was radically different to what I&#x2019;d imagined. <br>The road <br>He began by asking me to imagine I was sitting on the side of a very busy road, with a blindfold around my head. &#x201c;Now,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;maybe you can hear the background noise, the cars whizzing by, but you can&#x2019;t see them because you have your eyes covered, right?&#x201d; I imagined myself sitting on the grass verge of a motorway (the M4 as it happens) and nodded in agreement. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; he went on, &#x201c;before you start to meditate it can feel a bit like this. Because of all the background noise in the mind, all the thoughts, it means that even when you sit down to relax or go to bed at night, it still feels as though this noise continues, yes?&#x201d; It was hard to argue with this, because it did indeed feel as though there was always a certain amount of background noise or restlessness in my mind, even when I was not consciously aware of the individual thoughts. <br>&#x201c;Now, imagine taking the blindfold off,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;For the first time you see the road, your mind, clearly. You see the cars racing by, the different colors, shapes and sizes. Maybe sometimes you are attracted by the sound of the cars, at other times more interested in their appearance. But this is what it&#x2019;s like when you first take off the blindfold.&#x201d; He started laughing to himself. &#x201c;You know,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;sometimes it&#x2019;s at this point that people learning meditation say some very funny things. They start to blame their thoughts and feelings on the meditation. Can you believe it?&#x201d; he asked mockingly. &#x201c;They come and see me and say &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s happening, where all these thoughts are coming from. I never usually think this much, it must be the meditation making me think all the time,&#x2019; as if the meditation is somehow making their situation worse.&#x201d; His laughter trailed off as he picked up the thread of his explanation. <br>&#x201c;So, the first thing to get straight is that meditation does not make you think! All it does is shine a big bright light on your mind so that you can see it more clearly. This bright light is awareness. You may not like what you see when you switch the light on, but it&#x2019;s a clear and accurate reflection of how your mind behaves on a daily basis.&#x201d; I sat there and considered his words. He was definitely right about one thing&#x2014;I&#x2019;d been blaming meditation for the state of my mind ever since I started. I couldn&#x2019;t believe that my mind was really like that all the time. Or at least I didn&#x2019;t want to believe it was. I wondered if perhaps I was beyond help altogether, that no amount of meditation was going to help. It turns out that this is a surprisingly common feeling though, so be reassured if you feel this way too. <br>My teacher seemed to sense where I was going and interrupted my thoughts. &#x201c;This is how the mind looks to begin with,&#x201d; he said softly, &#x201c;not just your mind, but everybody&#x2019;s. That&#x2019;s why training the mind is so important. When you see the mind in this confused state it&#x2019;s very difficult to know what to do about it. For some people it&#x2019;s difficult not to panic. Sometimes people try to stop the thoughts through force. At other times they try and ignore them, to think about something else instead. Or if the thoughts are very interesting, then they might try to encourage them and get involved in them. But all these tactics are just ways of trying to avoid the reality of what is. If you think back to the busy road, it&#x2019;s no different from getting up from the side of the road, running among the cars and trying to control the traffic.&#x201d; He paused for a moment. &#x201c;This is quite a risky strategy,&#x201d; he said, laughing again. <br>Sound familiar? Once again, he was right. That&#x2019;s exactly what I&#x2019;d been doing and not just in my meditation. It summed up my life in general. I&#x2019;d been trying to control everything. Seeing the chaos of my mind when I sat to meditate had simply triggered the habitual tendency to jump in and take charge, to sort everything out. When that hadn&#x2019;t worked, I&#x2019;d just ramped up the effort. But then that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re taught when we&#x2019;re young, isn&#x2019;t it? &#x201c;Must try harder.&#x201d; So I&#x2019;d just kept trying harder. But it turns out no amount of force will result in a feeling of calm. <br>My teacher continued by making a suggestion. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s an idea&#x2014;rather than running around in the traffic trying to control everything, why not try staying where you are for a moment? What happens then? What happens when you stay on the side of the road and just watch as the traffic goes past? Maybe it&#x2019;s rush hour and the road&#x2019;s full of cars, or maybe it&#x2019;s the middle of the night and there are very few cars at all. It doesn&#x2019;t really matter which it is. The point is to get used to &#x2018;holding your seat&#x2019; on the side of the road and watching the traffic go by.&#x201d; I found the idea of just watching the thoughts go by quite easy to imagine and for once I was actually in a hurry to get back to my meditation cushion. <br>&#x201c;When you start to approach your meditation in this way you&#x2019;ll notice that your perspective changes,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;In stepping back from the thoughts and feelings, there will be a sense of increased space. It might feel as if you are simply an observer, watching the thoughts, the traffic, go by. Sometimes you might forget,&#x201d; he said, smiling knowingly, &#x201c;and before you know it you&#x2019;ll find yourself running down the road after a fancy-looking car. This is what happens when you experience a pleasant thought. You see it, get caught up in it, and end up chasing after the thought.&#x201d; He was now laughing loudly as he imagined me chasing the cars. &#x201c;But then all of a sudden, you&#x2019;ll realize what you&#x2019;re doing and, <i>in that moment</i>, you&#x2019;ll have the opportunity to return to your seat at the side of the road. At other times, you might see some traffic coming that you don&#x2019;t like the look of. Maybe it&#x2019;s an old rusty car, an unpleasant thought, and you&#x2019;ll no doubt rush out into the traffic to try and stop it. You might try to resist this feeling or thought for quite some time before you realize that you&#x2019;re back in the road again. But the moment you do, <i>in that moment</i>, you have the opportunity to take up your position on the side of the road again.&#x201d; He continued, now speaking more deliberately. &#x201c;Over time, this will get easier. You won&#x2019;t want to run out into the road quite so often and you&#x2019;ll find it easier and easier to just sit and watch the thoughts go by. <i>This</i> is the process of meditation.&#x201d; <br>It&#x2019;s worth taking some time to reflect on this analogy and as I sat there I considered what he&#x2019;d said. It all made so much sense, at least theoretically. But there were a couple of points that didn&#x2019;t feel right. If I was just sitting there as an observer to the thoughts, then who was doing the thinking? Surely I can&#x2019;t be doing both at the same time? &#x201c;Your thoughts are autonomous,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;Of course, if you want to think about something you can, you have that ability to reflect, to remember, or to project into the future and imagine how things might be. But what about the thoughts that just &#x2018;pop&#x2019; into your mind when you sit to meditate, or when you&#x2019;re walking down the street, or sitting at your desk trying to read a book? What about those thoughts? You didn&#x2019;t bring those thoughts to mind, did you? They <i>came</i> to mind. One minute you&#x2019;re reading a book and the next the thought of an old friend &#x2018;pops&#x2019; into your mind. You haven&#x2019;t thought of this friend for a long time and you made no conscious effort to <i>bring</i> him to mind and yet, all of a sudden, there he is!&#x201d; This was definitely something I&#x2019;d experienced a lot. I don&#x2019;t know if it&#x2019;s something that ever happens to you, but I&#x2019;d often start reading a page of a book, only to reach the end and realize that not a word had gone in. Inevitably, somewhere along the way a thought had popped up and I&#x2019;d become distracted, often without even being aware of it. <br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; he continued, &#x201c;these thoughts that we try so hard to suppress, to get away from or to stop altogether, are pretty much just popping up whenever they feel like it, right? We like to think we control our minds, control the flow of thought, but if it was possible to do that then you wouldn&#x2019;t have traveled halfway around the world for my advice.&#x201d; He pointed at me, playfully, laughing. &#x201c;In fact, if it were possible to control your thoughts then you&#x2019;d never have any reason to get stressed at all. You&#x2019;d simply block out all the unpleasant thoughts and live peacefully with all your happy thoughts.&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t believe how obvious it sounded when he explained it like that. It was almost as if I already knew it at some level, but had somehow forgotten to apply the idea to my life. &#x201c;But what about productive thoughts?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;What about creative thoughts, ones that are necessary to solve problems?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not saying that all thinking is bad,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We need the ability to think in order to live. It&#x2019;s the nature of mind to think. In the same way that the road was built for cars to journey on, so the mind exists to experience thoughts and feelings. So don&#x2019;t make the mistake of thinking that all thoughts are bad. They&#x2019;re not&#x2014;we just need to know how to relate to them. What you need to ask yourself,&#x201d; he continued, &#x201c;is how much of your thinking is helpful, productive, and how much is unhelpful or unproductive. Only <i>you</i> know the answer to that. I&#x2019;m assuming that because you&#x2019;ve come all this way to see me, your thinking causes you problems at times, that maybe some of it is not so helpful?&#x201d; There was no arguing with that. A great many of my thoughts fell into the &#x201c;unhelpful and unproductive&#x201d; category. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re worried about losing these creative thoughts,&#x201d; he gestured somewhat dismissively, &#x201c;then where do you think they come from in the first place? Do those moments of inspiration come from cold, rational thinking, or do they arise from the stillness and the spaciousness of the mind? When the mind is always busy there&#x2019;s no room for these thoughts to arise, so by training your mind you&#x2019;ll actually make <i>more</i> space for these creative thoughts to arise. The point is, don&#x2019;t be a slave to your mind. If you want to direct your mind and use it well, then good. But what use is the mind if it&#x2019;s all over the place, with no sense of direction or stability?&#x201d; <br>Having thanked my teacher for his time I returned to my room to mull over all we&#x2019;d discussed. Every point seemed to be as important as the next. For me it was a radically different way of approaching meditation, and I suspect it may well be for you too. But in that one short meeting I&#x2019;d learned that meditation, within a mindful context, was not about stopping thoughts and controlling the mind. It was a process of giving up control, of stepping back, learning how to focus the attention in a passive way, while simply resting the mind in its own natural awareness. My teacher had explained how it was a skill, an art, knowing how to step back and how not to get continually sucked into the realm of endless, unproductive and often stressful thinking. I&#x2019;d learned how the thoughts were autonomous and how no amount of force could prevent them from arising. <br>Over the next few weeks I became increasingly enthusiastic about my meditation. This new way of approaching the same technique had been a revelation. It seemed to make a difference the very first time I tried it. Of course, sometimes I&#x2019;d forget and slip back into my old habits, but slowly these new ideas started to take root. At times the mind continued to be very busy, just as my teacher had promised, but on other occasions it became very, very quiet. It was as if the volume of cars on the road had decreased to such an extent that I could now see the individual cars a lot more clearly. Not only that, but the space between these cars was now longer, wider, bigger. In fact, sometimes there appeared to be no cars at all. And it was then that I finally understood the confusion I&#x2019;d experienced in learning meditation. Having heard about these moments of &#x201c;no thought&#x201d; or &#x201c;empty space,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d always assumed that it was something I had to <i>do</i>. As it turns out, though, it is in <i>not doing</i> that those moments arise. It is stepping back and allowing the mind to unwind in its own time and its own way that you will find a genuine sense of headspace. <br>The blue sky <br>So, how do you &#x201c;not do something,&#x201d; while engaged in an exercise that is designed to &#x201c;do something?&#x201d; Despite the advice I&#x2019;d received, this was an idea I still struggled with from time to time. Sure, sitting on the side of the road was fine for a little while, but before long I found myself impatiently waiting for more progress. It&#x2019;s hard to believe that a sense of calm was not enough to satisfy me, but I wanted more, I wanted insight. Because although the thoughts had started to settle down, I was still left with a lot of the usual emotional stuff. Whether it was feeling frustrated, worried or doubtful, these emotions seemed to cloud my experience of meditation time and time again. I also found it hard to believe that such a passive approach was really going to lead to any long-lasting change. It was one thing to experience a sense of calm in the monastery, but quite another to imagine this working among the chaos of everyday life.

Every day thousands of lives are altered by these changes. Most managers and employees, however, do not have the experience to effectively work through such transitions. In <i>Managing Transitions,</i> William Bridges provides a clear understanding of what change does to employees and what employees in transition can do to an organization, and he shows how to minimize the distress and disruptions caused by change.Directed at managers and employees in today's corporations, where change is necessary to revitalize and improve corporate performance, <i>Managing Transitions </i> addresses the fact that it is people who have to carry out the change. It not only talks about what should be done, but also shows how to do it, giving managers practical ways to bring the people &#x201d;on board.&#x201d; Armed with this new information, managers will look at future changes in a new way, no longer feeling anxious and hopeless, but rather looking at opportunities.Everybody talks about &#x201d;managing change&#x201d; and &#x201d;resistance to change,&#x201d; but Bridges is the first to talk about what is going on inside the people who have to make the change work. He is the first to provide any real sense of the emotional impact of change and what can be done to keep it from disrupting the entire organization. Bridges's years of experience helping organizations and individuals successfully take control of change has proven the need for specific, concrete guidelines for dealing with change. <i> Managing Transitions</i> provides these guidelines.</p><p>Formerly a professor of English, <b>William Bridges</b> made a shift to the field of transitional management in the mid-1970s; out of his workshops has grown a long career of consulting, lecturing, and helping others through transitions.

A passionate report from the front lines</b><br><br>For centuries few terrors were more vivid in the West than fear of "the Turk," and many people still think of Turkey as repressive, wild, and dangerous. Crescent and Star is Stephen Kinzer's compelling report on the truth about this nation of contradictions - poised between Euroep and Asia, caught between the glories of its Ottoman past and its hopes for a democratic future, between the dominance of its army and the needs of its civilian citizens, between its secular expectations and its Muslim traditions.<br><br>Kinzer vividly describes Turkey's captivating delights as he smokes a water pipe, searches for the ruins of lost civilizations, watches a camel fight, and discovers its greatest poet. But he is also attund to the political landscape, taking us from Istanbul's elegant cafes to wild mountain outposts on Turkey's eastern borders, while along the way he talks to dissidents and patriots, villagers and cabinet ministers. He reports on political trials and on his own arrest by Turkish soldiers when he was trying to uncover secrets about the army's campaigns against Kurdish guerillas. He explores the nation's hope to join the European Union, the human-rights abuses that have kept it out, and its difficult relations with Kurds, Armenians, and Greeks.<br><br>Will this vibrant country, he asks, succeed in becoming a great democratic state? He makes it clear why Turkey is poised to become "the most audacious nation of the twenty-first century."<br></p><p><b>Stephen Kinzer</b> was Istanbul bureau chief for <i>The New York Times</i> and is now that paper's national cultural correspondent. He is the author of <i>Blood of Brothers</i> and co-author of <i>Bitter Fruit: The Untold Story of the American Coup in Guatemala</i>. He lives in Chicago.<br>A passionate love for the Turkish people and an optimism that its ruling class can complete Turkey's transformation into a Western-style democracy mark Kinzer's reflections on a country that sits geographically and culturally at the crossroads between Europe and Asia. Kinzer, the former New York Times Istanbul bureau chief, gives a concise introduction to Turkey: Kemal Ataterk's post-WWI establishment of the modern secular Turkish state; the odd makeup of contemporary society, in which the military enforces Ataterk's reforms. In stylized but substantive prose, he devotes chapters to the problems he sees plaguing Turkish society: Islamic fundamentalism, frictions regarding the large Kurdish minority and the lack of democratic freedoms. Kinzer's commonsense, if naeve, solution: the ruling military elite, which takes power when it feels Turkey is threatened, must follow the modernizing path of Ataterk whom Kinzer obviously admires a step further and increase human rights and press freedoms. Kinzer's journalistic eye serves him well as he goes beyond the political, vividly describing, for instance, the importance and allure of the narghile salon, where Turks smoke water pipes. Here, as elsewhere, Kinzer drops his journalist veneer and gets personal, explaining that he enjoys the salons in part "because the sensation of smoking a water pipe is so seductive and satisfying." Readers who want a one-volume guide to this fascinating country need look no further. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Early Anabaptist Spirituality: Selected Writings (Classics of Western Spirituality (Paperback))</h2><p>The most in-depth and scholarly panorama of Western spirituality ever attempted!In one series, the original writings of the universally acknowledged teachers of the Catholic, Protestant, Eastern Orthodox, Jewish, Islamic and Native American traditions have been critically selected, translated and introduced by internationally recognized scholars and spiritual leaders.The texts are first-rate, and the introductions are informative and reliable.

Some 650 works by such renowned artists as Max Beckmann, Marc Chagall, Otto Dix, Wassily Kandinsky, and Paul Klee were removed from German museums and assembled in a traveling exhibition that the Nazis called &#34;Degenerate Art.&#34; Fifty years later, the L.A. County Museum of Art reconstructed the notorious exhibition. This catalogue not only recreates the original show, but contains exhaustively researched essays on such topics as the Nazi ideals of beauty and resistance efforts by some German museums. Biographical information is available for each persecuted artist as well as rare photographs, and there is a room by room survey of and guide to the 1939 exhibition with a new English translation. Artistic expression is still under attack by such groups as the NEA, making this book strikingly relevant today.Recently seen in Los Angeles and traveling to Chicago, "Degenerate Art" is an exhibit attempting to re-present works still available from the 1937 exhibit of the same name mounted by the Nazis--an exhibit that redefined the aesthetics behind modern art. Though this book, which accompanies the exhibition, contains 150 pages of reproductions and biographies of the artists, it is not merely an exhibition catalog. It is a history book that attempts to put those works in the context of the original show and further place that exhibition in the context of the Nazis' overall attempts to control "German" attitudes by redefining cultural models. Documents (the floorplan of the exhibition, the original catalog with translation) and essays on events antecedent and tangential to the notorious show form a now particularly relevant history of government-valued artistic merit.

He drove between the posts and onto the forest-flanked lane, driving too quickly over the bumps and ruts.</p><p>Lacey pressed her palm against the dashboard for balance. Although it was only dusk, it was already dark along the tree-shrouded gravel lane leading to the Kiss River light station. "You'd better slow down," she said. "I nearly ran over an opossum on this road last night."</p><p>Obediently, Tom lifted his foot from the gas pedal. "I'm glad you don't live out here alone," he said in the paternal tone he occasionally used with her since learning he was her biological father a decade ago. "I'd be worried about you all the time."</p><p>"Well," Lacey sighed. "I won't be living out here too much longer." The Coast Guard had finally decided to turn the nearly restored keeper's house into a museum, a decision she had hoped would never come.</p><p>"You're upset about it, huh?"</p><p>"Oh, a bit." She was frankly scared, although of what, she couldn't say. The isolation the keeper's house had offered her had been more than welcome, it had been necessary, especially this last difficult year. "They've restored every inch of it except the living room and the sunroom." She shared a studio in Kill Devil Hills with Tom, but she'd turned the sunroom of the keeper's house into a small studio, as well, so she could work on her stained glass when she was at home. "They'll restore the sunroom after I leave, and the living room will be turned into a little shop and information area."</p><p>"When do they want you out?" he asked. They were nearing the end of the road. A bit of dusky daylight broke through the trees and she could clearly see the gray in Tom's wiry blond ponytail and the glint of light from the small gold hoop in his ear.</p><p>"Some time after the first of the year," she said.</p><p>"Where will you...holy shit." Tom had driven from the gravel road into the parking lot, and the keeper's house came into view in the evening light. The upper portions of nearly every window were aglow with her stained glass creations.</p><p>She followed his gaze to the house. "In the year and a half I've lived here, you haven't seen the keeper's house at night?" she asked.</p><p>Tom stopped the car in the middle of the lot and a smile came slowly to his lips. Shaking his head, he leaned over to pull Lacey toward him, wrapping her in the scent of tobacco as he kissed the top of her head. She had gotten him to stop drinking, but had failed at getting him to give up cigarettes.</p><p>"You're your mother, Lace," he said. "This is just the sort of thing she would do. Turn her home into a...I don't know. Someplace magical."</p><p>She felt defeated. She wanted to tell him that she was not her mother any longer, that she had worked hard this last year to rid herself of her mother's persona. Apparently she had not succeeded. It was hard to succeed when you had no identity of your own to take the place of the one you were trying to discard.</p><p>She was surprised to see her father's van parked in the lot next to Clay's Jeep. "Dad is here," she said. "Weird."</p><p>"He doesn't come to visit you much?" Tom asked, and she heard the competitive edge in his voice. Tom often displayed a quiet envy of Alec O'Neill for having had the honor of raising her.</p><p>"He's smitten with Rani," she said, not really answering the question. "He likes having a grandbaby."</p><p>Tom laughed. "You have one hell of a complicated family, you know that?"</p><p>"I do, indeed." Lacey unfastened her seat belt. The tight little nuclear family she'd grown up in had added and subtracted so many people that it sometimes seemed difficult to keep track of them all. To complicate her life even further, she worked with both her fathers, spending her mornings in the animal hospital run by the father who had raised her and her afternoons in the art studio with the father who had given her life.</p><p>"Is that a kennel?" Tom pointed toward the large fenced area near the edge of the woods. "Is Clay training dogs again?"</p><p>"Uh-huh," she said. "He's been back at it a few months now." With Gina and Rani in his life, her brother had undergone a metamorphosis. He was a devoted husband, and practically overnight, he'd developed parenting skills she had never expected to see in him. But it was the day she'd watched him roll chunks of wood and concrete into the forest&#x2014;obstacles for the dogs he trained in search-and-rescue work&#x2014;that she knew he was once again a man at peace with his world.</p><p>She realized that Tom had not moved his car from the center of the lot.</p><p>"Park your car and come in for a while," she said.</p><p>He shook his head. "No, I'll just head on home."</p><p>"You know you're welcome," she said.</p><p>"I know that, sugar. But...I just never feel comfortable around Alec. Your dad."</p><p>Lacey smiled. "I'm nearly twenty-six years old, Tom," she said. "What happened between you and my mother is ancient history and you know my father got over it a long time ago."</p><p>"Some other time," Tom said.</p><p>"Okay." She opened the car door and stepped out. "I'll see you tomorrow."</p><p>She waved as he turned the car around and drove back onto the gravel lane. Slipping off her sandals, she dangled them over her fingertips and started walking across the sand toward the house. The air was thick with salt, and the rhythmic pounding of the waves against the shore was nearly drowned out by the buzz of cicadas.</p><p>She often wondered if she should tell Tom the truth about her mother. It was clear that he thought he had been her only affair, as if he alone had been so irresistible that he could cause a woman as saintly as Annie O'Neill to stray. As far as Lacey knew, he did not date anyone, still so haunted by Annie's ghost that he thought it impossible to find a woman who could take her place. Yet Lacey couldn't bring herself to hurt him with the truth.</p><p>Inside the house, Clay's black lab, Sasha, ran into the kitchen to greet her, and she dropped her sandals on the floor and bent down to scratch the dog behind his ears. The room smelled of Gina's cooking&#x2014;cardamom and turmeric, coconut and ginger. She could hear voices coming from the living room.</p><p>"Who's here, Sash?" she said, as if she didn't know. "Let's go see."</p><p>Sasha led the way through the kitchen to the living room, tail wagging, and Lacey stopped in the doorway of the room, not wanting to interrupt the scene in front of her. Gina was stretched out on the sofa, grinning, her arms folded behind her head as she watched Clay and Alec playing on the floor with Rani and her dolls. Clay was making the Indian Barbie, which was bedecked in a pink sari, walk across the rug toward the plastic dollhouse.</p><p>"Let's go to Rani's house!" he said in a high-pitched voice.</p><p>Alec was walking a brown-skinned baby doll&#x2014;a big blob of a doll compared to the slender, shapely Barbie&#x2014;around on the carpet. "No," he said. "I want to go fishing!"</p><p>Rani looked alarmed, reaching for the baby doll. "No, no, no!" she said, her enormous black eyes wide in her caramel-colored face. "Everyone comes to <i>my</i> house."</p><p>Lacey laughed. At nearly two and a half, Rani tried hard to control her world. She'd had so little opportunity to control it during her first two years that she was making up for lost time. The little girl looked up at the sound of Lacey's laughter, then jumped up from the floor.</p><p>"Lacey!" she said, running toward her. "I love you!"</p><p>Lacey bent down to pick her up. She was a little peanut of a child. So tiny. So full ofjoy. And so, so wanted.</p><p>"Hi, baby," Lacey said. "I love you, too."</p><p>Gina had struggled to adopt Rani, and once Clay had fallen in love with Gina, he had joined that struggle with his whole heart. They'd spent from July to September in India the year before, fighting the system to get the court's permission to adopt Rani. The little girl had desperately needed heart surgery, but so many obstacles stood in the way of the adoption that Gina had feared the toddler might die before she could bring her home. Once permission had been received, the three of them were quickly ushered out of the country, escaping before the foreign adoption antagonists could become involved. By that time, Rani was so weak from her heart condition that she could barely hold her head up, and Gina and Clay feared it might be too late to save her. Gina had already made contact with a surgeon in Seattle, so she flew there with Rani. The surgery was successful and the two of them remained in Seattle as Rani healed. Clay had moped around the keeper's house, unable to think of anything other than the woman and baby he had fallen in love with. He and Gina talked for hours on the phone&#x2014;for so long, in fact, that Lacey had insisted he get a separate phone line installed in the keeper's house. In February, Gina and Rani traveled across the country to the Outer Banks. Gina and Clay were married the following day, and Rani, who had arrived shy and quiet and skinny as a twig, quickly blossomed into an insatiable chatterbox who fully recognized her role as the center of the universe. She was spoiled&#x2014;if it was possible to spoil a child who had spent her first two years with little more than dirt and deprivation&#x2014;and no one cared.</p><p>Lacey carried Rani over to the sofa and sat down next to Gina's bare feet. She looked at her father, who still sat on the floor, holding the fat bab...</p></p><h2>The Third World War: The untold story</h2><p>What if story of soviets attaching in Europe and throughout the world</p><p></p><h2>Universe of Stone: A Biography of Chartres Cathedral</h2><p>Chartres Cathedral, south of Paris, is revered as one of the most beautiful and profound works of art in the Western canon. But what did it mean to those who constructed it in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries? And why, during this time, did Europeans begin to build churches in a new style, at such immense height and with such glorious play of light, in the soaring manner we now call Gothic? <br> <p><br> Universe of Stone shows that the Gothic cathedrals encode a far-reaching shift in the way medieval thinkers perceived their relationship with their world. For the first time, they began to believe in an orderly, rational world that could be investigated and understood. This change marked the beginning of Western science and also the start of a long and, indeed, unfinished struggle to reconcile faith and reason. <br> </p><p><br> By embedding the cathedral in the culture of the twelfth centuryits schools of philosophy and science, its trades and technologies, its politics and religious debatesPhilip Ball makes sense of the visual and emotional power of Chartres. Beautifully illustrated and written, filled with astonishing insight, Universe of Stone argues that Chartres is a sublime expression of the originality and vitality of a true "first renaissance," one that occurred long before the birth of Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, or Francis Bacon.</p></p><p><p>Philip Ball's book <em>Bright Earth: Art and the Invention of Color</em> was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award; his <em>Critical Mass: How One Thing Leads to Another</em> won the UK's Aventis Prize. He is a consulting editor for <em>Nature</em> magazine, and he lives in London.</p>In this lively biography of Chartres Cathedral, Ball explores the configuration of cultural and technological factors that enabled Europe to achieve a "liberation from gravity" in the twelfth century, including the rise of scholasticism, Platonic obsessions with light and proportion, and heroic masons who "turned geometry into stone." The accomplishments of Gothic architecture were all the more remarkable given that stonework was virtually forgotten in the West in the centuries after Rome fell. Though much of the history of Chartres Cathedral remains opaque, Ball&#x2019;s account of its construction reveals fascinating details (such as the origins of its blue glass, likely scavenged from Roman or Byzantine sites) and evokes its raison d&#x2019;�tre: in an era when architecture "existed to reveal the deep design of God&#x2019;s creation," Chartres "encoded a set of symbols and relationships that mapped out the universe itself." <br>Copyright �2008<i>Click here to subscribe to The New Yorker</i></p><h2>If There Be Thorns</h2><p>Now a major Lifetime movie event&#x2014;Book Three of the Dollanganger series that began with <i>Flowers in the Attic</i>&#x2014;the novel of forbidden love that captured the world&#x2019;s imagination and earned V.C.

When I saw that house I automatically slowed, knowing soon I'd be home.<br>An acre from that house was our home, sitting isolated and lonely on a road that had more twists and turns than a puzzle maze that leads the mouse to the cheese. We lived in Fairfax, Marin County, about twenty miles north of San Francisco. There was a redwood forest on the other side of the mountains, and the ocean too. Ours was a cold place, sometimes dreary. The fog would roll in in great billowing waves and often shrouded the landscape all day, turning everything cold and eerie. The fog was spooky, but it was also romantic and mysterious.<br>As much as I loved my home, I had vague, disturbing memories of a southern garden full of giant magnolia trees dripping with Spanish moss. I remembered a tall man with dark hair turning gray; a man who called me his son. I didn't remember his face nearly as well as I remembered the nice warm and safe feeling he gave me. I guess one of the saddest things about growing bigger, and older, was that no one was large enough, or strong enough, to pick you up and hold you close and make you feel that safe again.<br>Chris was my mother's third husband. My own father died before I was born; his name was Julian Marquet, and everyone in the ballet world knew about him. Hardly anyone outside of Clairmont, South Carolina, knew about Dr. Paul Scott Sheffield, who had been my mother's second husband. In that same southern state, in the town of Greenglenna, lived my paternal grandmother, Madame Marisha.<br>She was the one who wrote me a letter each week, and once a summer we visited her. It seemed she wanted almost as much as I did, for me to become the most famous dancer the world had ever known. And thus I would prove to her, and to everyone, that my father had not lived and died in vain.<br>By no means was my grandmother an ordinary little old lady going on seventy-four. Once she'd been very famous, and not for one second did she let anyone forget this. It was a rule I was never to call her Grandmother when others could overhear and possibly guess her age. She'd whispered to me once that it would be all right if I called her <i>Mother,</i> but that didn't seem right when I already had a mother whom I loved very much. So I called her Madame Marisha, or Madame M., just as everyone else did.<br>Our yearly visit to South Carolina was long anticipated during the winters, and quickly forgotten once we were back and safely snuggled in our little valley where our long redwood house nestled. "Safe in the valley where the wind doesn't blow," my mother said often. Too often, really -- as if the wind blowing greatly distressed her.<br>I reached our curving drive, parked my bike and went inside the house. No sign of Bart or Mom. Heck! I raced into the kitchen where Emma was preparing dinner. She spent most of her time in the kitchen, and that accounted for her "pleasingly plump" figure. She had a long, dour face unless she was smiling; fortunately, she smiled most of the time. She could order you to do this, do that, and with her smile take the pain from the ordeal of doing for yourself, which was something my brother Bart refused to do. I suspected Emma waited on Bart more than me because he spilled when he tried to pour his own milk. He dropped when he carried a glass of water. There wasn't anything he could hold onto, and nothing he could keep from bumping into. Tables fell, lamps toppled. If an extension wire was anywhere in the house Bart would be sure to snag his sneaker toes underneath and down he'd go -- or the blender, the mixer, or the radio, would crash to the floor.<br>"Where's Bart?" I asked Emma, who was peeling potatoes to put in with the roast beef she had in the oven.<br>"I tell you, Jory, I'll be glad when that boy stays in school just as long as you do. I hate to see him come in the kitchen. I have to stop what I'm doing and look around and anticipate just what he might knock off or bump into. Thank God he's got that wall to sit on. What is it you boys do up on that wall, anyway?"<br>"Nothing," I said. I didn't want to tell her how often we stole over to the deserted mansion beyond the wall and played there. The estate was off-limits to us, but parents weren't supposed to see and know everything. Next I asked "Where's Mom?" Emma said she'd come home early after cancelling her ballet class, which I already knew. "Half her class has colds," I explained. "But where is she now?"<br>"Jory, I can't keep my eye on everybody and still know what <i>I'm</i> doing. A few minutes ago she said something about going up to the attic for old pictures. Why don't you join her up there and help her search?"<br>That was Emma's nice way of saying I was in her way. I headed for the attic stairs, which were hidden in the far end of our large walk-in linen closet in the back hall. Just as I was passing through the family room I heard the front door open and close. To my surprise I saw my dad standing stock-stiff in the foyer, a strange look of reflection in his blue eyes, making me reluctant to call out and break into his thoughts. I paused, undecided.<br>He headed for his bedroom after he put down his black doctor's bag. He had to pass the linen closet with its door slightly ajar. He stopped, listening as I was to the faint sound of ballet music drifting down the stairs. Why was my mother up there? Dancing there again? Whenever I asked why she danced in such a dusty place, she explained she was "compelled" to dance up there, despite the heat and dust. "Don't you tell your father about this," she'd warned me several times. After I questioned her, she'd stopped going up there -- and now she was doing it again.<br>This time I was going up. This time I was going to listen to the excuses she gave <i>him.</i> For Dad would catch her!<br>On tiptoe I trailed him up the steep, narrow stairs. He paused directly under the bare electric bulb that hung down from the apex of the attic. He riveted his eyes upon my mom, who kept right on dancing as if she didn't see him there. She held a dustmop in one hand and playfully swiped at this or that, miming Cinderella and certainly not Princess Aurora from <i>The Sleeping Beauty,</i> which was the music she had on the ancient record player.<br>Gosh. My stepfather's heart seemed to jump right up into his eyes. He looked scared, and I sensed she was hurting him just by dancing in the attic. How odd. I didn't understand what went on between them. I was fourteen, Bart was nine, and we were both a long, long way from being adults. The love they had for each other seemed to me very different from the love I saw between the parents of the few friends I had. Their love seemed more intense, more tumultuous, more passionate. Whenever they thought no one was watching they locked eyes, and they had to reach out and touch whenever they passed one another.<br>Now that I was an adolescent, I was beginning to take more notice of what went on between the most meaningful models I had. I wondered often about the different facets my parents had. One for the public to view; another for Bart and me, and the third, most fervent side, which they showed only to each other. (How could they know their two sons were not always discreet enough to turn away and leave like they should?)<br>Maybe that was the way all adults were, especially parents.<br>Dad kept staring as Mom whirled in fast <i>pirouettes</i> that fanned her long blonde hair out in a half circle. Her leotards were white, her <i>pointes</i> white too, and I was enthralled as she danced, wielding that dust-mop like a sword to stab at old furniture that Bart and I had outgrown. Scattered on the floor and shelves were broken toys, kiddy-cars and scooters, dishes she or Emma had broken that she meant to glue back together one day. With each swipe of her dustmop she brought zillions of golden dustmotes into play. Frenzied and crazy they struggled to settle down before she attacked again and once more drove them into flight.<br>"Depart!" she cried, as a queen to her slaves. "Go and stay away! Torment me no more!" -- and round and round she spun, so fast I had to turn to follow her with my eyes or end up dizzy just from watching. She whipped her head, her leg, doing <i>fouettes</i> with more expertise than I'd seen on stage. Wild and possessed she spun faster! faster! keeping time to the music, using the mop as part of her action, making housework so dramatic I wanted to kick off my shoes and jump in and join her and be the partner my real father had once been. But I could only stand in the dim purplish shadows and watch something I sensed I shouldn't be watching.<br>My dad swallowed over the lump which must have risen in his throat. Mom looked so beautiful, so young and soft. She was thirty-seven, so old in years but so young in appearance, and so easily she could be wounded by an unkind word. Just as easily as any sixteen-year-old dancer in her classes.<br>"Cathy!" cried Dad, jerking the needle from the record so the music screeched to a halt. "STOP! What are you doing?"<br>She heard and fluttered her slim pale arms in mock fright, flittering toward him, using the tiny, even steps called <i>bourr�s.</i> For a second or so only, before she was again spinning in a series of <i>pirouettes</i> around him, encircling him-and swiping at him with her dustmop! "STOP IT!" he yelled, seizing hold of her mop and hurling it away. He grabbed her waist, pinioning her arms to her sides as a deep blush rose to stain her cheeks. He released his hold enough to allow her arms to flutter like broken bird wings so her hands could cover her throat. Above those crossed pale hands her blue eyes grew larger and very dark. Her full lips began to quiver, and slowly, slowly, with awful reluctance she was forced to look where Dad's finger pointed.<br>I looked too and was surprised to see two twin beds set up in the portion of the attic that was soon to be under construction. Dad had promised her we'd have a recreation room up here. But twin beds in all this junk? Why?<br>Mom spoke then, her voice husky and scared. "Chris? You're home? You don't usually come home this early..."<br>He'd caught her and I was relieved. Now he could straighten her out, tell her not to dance up here again in the dry, dusty air that could make her faint. Even I could see she was having trouble coming up with some excuse.<br>"Cathy, I know I brought those bedsteads up, but how did you manage to put them together?" Dad shot out. "How did you manage the mattresses?" Then he jolted for a second time, spying the picnic hamper between the beds. "Cathy!" he roared, glaring at her. "Does history have to repeat itself? Can't we learn and benefit from the mistakes of others? <i>Do we have to do it all over again?"</i><br>Again? What was he talking about?<br>"Catherine," Dad went on in the same cold, hard voice, "don't stand there and try to look innocent, like some wicked child caught stealing. Why are those beds here, all made up with clean sheets and new blankets? Why the picnic hamper? Haven't we seen enough of that type of basket to last us our whole lives through?"<br>And here I was thinking she'd put the beds together so she and I could have a place to fall down and rest after we danced, as we had a few times. And a picnic hamper was, after all, just another basket.<br>I drifted closer, then hid behind a strut that rose to the rafters. Something sad and painful was between them; something young, fresh, like a raw wound that refused to heal. My mother looked ashamed and suddenly awkward. The man I called Dad stood bewildered; I could tell he wanted to take her in his arms and forgive her. "Cathy, Cathy," he pleaded with anguish, "don't be like <i>her</i> in every way!"<br>Mom jerked her head high, threw back her shoulders, and, with arrogant pride, glared him down. She flipped her long hair back from her face and smiled to charm him. Was she doing all of that just to make him stop asking questions she didn't want to answer?<br>I felt strangely cold in the musty gloom of the attic. A chilling shiver raced down my spine, making me want to run and hide. Making me ashamed, too, for spying -- that was Bart's way, not mine.<br>How could I escape without attracting their attention? I <i>had</i> to stay in my hidden place.<br>"Look at me, Cathy. You're not the sweet young ingenue anymore, and this is not a game. There is no reason for those beds to be there. And the picnic basket only compounds my fears. <i>What the hell are you planning?"</i><br>Her arms spread wide as if to hug him, but he pushed her away and spoke again: "Don't try to appeal to me when I feel sick to my stomach. I ask myself each day how I can come home and not be tired of you, and still feel as I do after so many years, and after all that has happened. Yet I go on year after year loving you, needing and trusting you. Don't take my love and make it into something ugly!"<br>Bewilderment clouded her expression. I'm sure it clouded mine too. Didn't he truly love her? Was that what he meant? Mom was staring at the beds again, as if surprised to see them there.<br>"Chris, help me!" she choked, stepping closer and opening her arms again. He put her off, shaking his head. She implored, "Please don't shake your head and act like you don't understand. I don't remember buying the basket, really I don't! I had a dream the other night about coming up here and putting the beds together, but when I came up today and saw them, I thought you must have put them there."<br>"Cathy! I DID <i>NOT</i> PUT THE BEDS THERE!"<br>"Move out of the shadows. I can't see you where you are." She lifted her small pale hands, seeming to wipe away invisible cobwebs. Then she was staring at her hands as if they'd betrayed her -- or was she really seeing spiderwebs tying her fingers together?<br>Just as my dad did, I looked around again. Never had the attic been so clean before. The floor had been scrubbed, cartons of old junk were stacked neatly. She had tried to make the attic look homey by hanging pretty pictures of flowers on the walls.<br>Dad was eyeing Mom as if she were crazy. I wondered what he was thinking, and why he couldn't tell what bothered her when he was the best doctor ever. Was he trying to decide if she was only pretending to forget? Did that dazed, troubled look in her terrified eyes tell him differently? Must have, for he said softly, kindly, "Cathy, you don't have to look scared. You're <i>not</i> swimming in a sea of deceit anymore, or helplessly caught in an undertow. You are <i>not</i> drowning. <i>Not</i> going under. <i>Not</i> having a nightmare. You don't have to clutch at straws when you have me." Then he drew her into his arms as she fell toward him, grasping as if to keep from drowning. "You're all right, darling," he whispered, stroking her back, touching her cheeks, drying the tears that began to flow. Tenderly he tilted her chin up before his lips slowly lowered to hers. The kiss lasted and lasted, making me hold my breath.<br>"The grandmother is dead. Foxworth Hall has been burned to the ground."<br><i>Foxworth Hall? What was that?</i><br>"No, it hasn't, Chris. I heard her climbing the stairs a short while ago, and you know she's afraid of small, confined places -- how could she climb the stairs?"<br>"Were you sleeping when you heard her?"<br>I shivered. What the devil were they talking about? Which grandmother?<br>"Yes," she murmured, her lips moving over his face. "I guess I did drift into nig...</p><h2>The Arms of Krupp: 1587-1968</h2><p>Non-Fiction, German Studies</p><p></p><h2>The Resistible Rise of Benito Mussolini</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p></p><h2>The Worrier&#39;s Guide to Overcoming Procrastination: Breaking Free from the Anxiety That Holds You Back (New Harbinger Self-Help Workbook)</h2><p><p>Break the Bonds of Anxiety-Driven Procrastination</p> <p>You know that postponing things you need to do can result in negative consequences-overdue bills, unhappy supervisors, disappointed friends and romantic partners, and feelings of guilt or dread-but something inside keeps you from taking action.

Journeys to the Dolomites, to the north shore of Lake Tahoe, from Paris and Tuscany to the shrine at Delphi, from Santa Fe to Sella Pass, Snyder lays out these poems as a map of the last decade. Placed side-by-side, they become a path and a trail of complexity and lyrical regard, a sort of riprap of the poet&#x2019;s eighth decade. And in the mix are some of the most beautiful domestic poems of his great career, poems about his work as a homesteader and householder, as a father and husband, as a friend and neighbor.

In developing his unique surfer-philosophical worldview, he draws from his own experience of surfing and from surf culture and lingo, and includes many relevant details from the lives of the philosophers, from Aristotle to Wittgenstein, with whose thought he engages. In the process, he'll speak to readers in search of personal and social meaning in our current anxious moment, by way of doing real, authentic philosophy.</p><p>AARON JAMES holds a PhD from Harvard and is professor of philosophy at the University of California, Irvine.

If the wave is any good for surfing, a sloping shoulder will pull up into the cresting curl, and a moving wave face will run along the beach, tracking the contours of sand or rock below. Assuming one is up and riding (no easy feat, and I&#x2019;ll come back to tips for beginners momentarily), the surfer glides along the wave face, in or around the wave&#x2019;s breaking curl. Then a lot of different things might happen. The wave may shift. Or shoulder. Or wall up. Or race along. Or tube.<br><br>Whatever is happening, the surfer has to sense it and adapt. The surfer has to sense what next moment is approaching and adjust as the coming moment asks, before the wave&#x2019;s curl passes one by.<br><br>They say it&#x2019;s good to &#x201c;go with the flow,&#x201d; in walking a city street, in a work project, in the day&#x2019;s tasks, and as a general way to live, with less anxiety, less striving, and a certain graceful success. &#x201c;Going with the flow&#x201d; is a pleasing metaphor for something&#x2014;�but what? The surfer literally goes along with a flowing natural phenomenon, often on a daily basis, in a way of life devoted to just that activity. So if we wanted a better sense of what truth lies behind the metaphor, we could do worse than look to what the surfer knows.<br><br><b>How to Surf</b><br><br>As an ocean swell approaches, mounting over shallow reef or sand, you&#x2019;ll want to catch it before the wave face peaks and pitches. With careful positioning, you paddle yourself under the vaulting peak, so as to be caught up and carried along by the wave&#x2019;s natural momentum. Then quickly move to your feet, pushing yourself up, pulling your body into a sideways upright posture, all while keeping a crouch and low center of gravity.<br><br>As you drop into the wave&#x2019;s quickly steepening face, suddenly picking up speed, you can start sensing how the wave might develop, how it might shift or inflect. Then try to respond as the wave is asking, pausing if it is shouldering or becoming less steep, or instead racing ahead if the face is walling up, because the wave section is about to pitch and crash. You keep adapting in each new moment, with a keen eye for the wave&#x2019;s next offer or request. With enough practice, you&#x2019;ll eventually be carried through from each moment to the next, flying along the whole wave&#x2019;s length, linking wave sections together, with effortless speed, fluent power, and stylish fluidity.<br><br>The beginner will wonder about basics. &#x201c;Respond&#x201d; how? What maneuvering might be &#x201c;asked&#x201d; of you? In which &#x201c;moments&#x201d;?<br><br>Unfortunately, here philosophy can&#x2019;t provide a definitive answer. It is much as Aristotle said of moral virtue, which he likened to an exercise of skill in sports. What to do next depends entirely on the wave situation before you, which can only be known in practice. Even on waves of the most machinelike predictability, there are just too many possible wave moments, each with its own apt reactions, for any rules or principles to tell you ahead of time how to go on in any definite way.<br><br>Still, one could come into a general sense of the variety. So consider a few key surfing moments.<br><br>PUMP: Sometimes you have to hurry down the line of the wave, and so you&#x2019;ll pump the surfboard up and down like a steam engine, because the wave face is walling up and might leave you caught behind a breaking section.<br><br>FADE: Or maybe the wave section is slowing, but about to rebuild, in which case you have to downshift, like hitting a downbeat note in a jazz riff, by fading back into the curl of the wave, in order to be well positioned as the wave steepens again.<br><br>SNAP: Unless you&#x2019;re already in exactly the right position, in which case you just unload your best turn! If the wave face is steep and hanging there for you, like an eager dance partner in waiting, you can place the surfboard right up in the wave curl&#x2019;s pocket, vertically, and snap it back to six o&#x2019;clock, while pushing the surfboard&#x2019;s tail through the rotation.<br><br>CUTBACK: If you&#x2019;re in a mellower mood, you might just project out onto the wave&#x2019;s sloping shoulder and lay down a long, carving turn, burning your speed, gradually unloading your strength, as you track through the arc of the turn, like a bar of soap slipping around in a bathtub.<br><br>ANTICIPATION: In any case, when you&#x2019;re in transition out of one of these other maneuvers, you want to be ready for the next section, sowing seed for the next harvest. While keeping an eye on what&#x2019;s going on down the wave&#x2019;s line, you quickly get back into a low, tight crouch, out of which you can spring into the next moment of release.<br><br>TUBE RIDE: Most important of all, if you&#x2019;re lucky, or the waves are just really good on that day in particular, the wave lip might suddenly be throwing out, while the wave trough is sucking up. You then tuck yourself under the curl in a balling crouch as the pitching curtain engulfs you in a spinning, roaring, snarling cylindrical vortex. Inside the tube, don&#x2019;t get too excited. But do go fast. Watch the lip line out in front of you so as not to get clipped when you could have tightened your crouch and kept going. Keep your weight forward. Pump or ease forward if you&#x2019;re getting drawn too deep in the tube, so as to sustain your momentum. Don&#x2019;t get caught up on the foam ball behind you, which can lift your surfboard fins and spin you into whitewash oblivion. And otherwise just wait for a chance to exit, which might well come, if the wave gods are showing you favor.<br><br>So, you know, like that. Depending on what is happening, you respond as the wave asks, which is to say, appropriately.<br><br>That is still not especially helpful. Appropriately how? Appropriately when? Those are the questions you&#x2019;d have to know how to answer to actually surf a wave, and you can&#x2019;t answer without having a wave actually before you, which is telling you what move comes next.<br><br>If a complete book of surfing&#x2019;s rules could be written, it wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily help unless you could also learn the &#x201c;know-�how&#x201d; that comes in faithful practice. You could read and understand all of its instructions, grasp them intellectually, and still not know how to put any rule into action. As a new wave situation presents itself, you have to know how to go on in the next moment. To borrow from Ludwig Wittgenstein, the enigmatic early-�mid-�twentieth-�century philosopher, if rules were all you had to go by, they couldn&#x2019;t tell you how to &#x201c;go on&#x201d; from what came before, even with suggestive coaching. Given only rules, with no further sense of how to apply them in a fresh particular moment, you&#x2019;d have to look to further rules to tell you which rules to follow and when. But then you&#x2019;d also need rules for applying those rules, and so on, without end, ad infinitum, all the way up. Which is absurd, or impossible, or just not what we do in learning to surf.<br><br>So there must be a different way of engaging one&#x2019;s situation, which isn&#x2019;t simply dictated by knowing rules, but somehow the basis for following and interpreting them. Here Wittgenstein says, &#x201c;If there has to be anything &#x2018;behind the utterance of the formula&#x2019; it is particular circumstances, which justify me in saying I can go on&#x2014;�when the formula occurs to me.&#x201d; And so one must have a way of knowing what one&#x2019;s situation is. There must be a different, more &#x201c;intuitive&#x201d; way of knowing how to sense and adapt to a new moment, which isn&#x2019;t simply grasping a rule&#x2019;s content intellectually.<br><br>For Martin Heidegger, the early-�mid-�twentieth-�century German philosopher who revived Aristotle&#x2019;s appreciation for the ordinary, our basic orientation to the world is not that of knowing things to be true by thought, reason, or perception. It is that of &#x201c;handiness,&#x201d; of knowing how to use things: &#x201c;The nearest kind of association is not mere perceptual cognition, but, rather, a handling, using, and taking care of things which has its own kind of &#x2018;knowledge.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>His central example is a hammer. You &#x201c;know&#x201d; it not by thinking about it, or staring at it, but by using it. You know the object as &#x201c;for-�hammering,&#x201d; with a sense of how to pick it up in your hand and pound a nail. And so it is for nearly all of human experience, which is made up of all manner of ordinary know-�how, supplied by the material culture that organizes all of our choices.<br><br>So life is less thought than action, or rather thought in action, without too much thinking. Philosophy, as the saying goes, doesn&#x2019;t bake bread. So of course it can&#x2019;t teach you to surf. Surfing, in a word, must be lived.<br><br>This might explain certain dissatisfactions with modern routinized work and why it is often contrasted with living. Following Heidegger, Matthew Crawford explains, based on his own experience in motorcycle maintenance, that &#x201c;craft knowledge&#x201d; in our ever-�refined division of labor is broken down into &#x201c;minute instructions&#x201d; that replaced experience, &#x201c;animated by the worker&#x2019;s own mental image of, and intention toward, the finished product.&#x201d; This contrasts with the older way of the tradesman:<br><br>The physical circumstances of the jobs performed by carpenters, plumbers, and auto mechanics vary too much for them to be executed by idiots; they require circumspection and adaptability. . . . The trades are then a natural home for anyone who would live by his own powers, free not only of deadening abstraction but also of the insidious hopes and rising insecurities that seem to be endemic in our current economic life.<br><br>The intuitive know-�how of trades work goes beyond mere &#x201c;knowledge that&#x201d; because, much as with surfing, it&#x2019;s &#x201c;always tied to the experience of a particular person. It can&#x2019;t be downloaded, it can only be lived.&#x201d; A machine such as Deep Blue, the chess-�playing computer that beat the grandmaster Garry Kasparov, only simulates the tacit, intuitive knowledge of an embodied, living person. Because this living know-�how is the source of work&#x2019;s human meaning, to replace it with narrow rule following is to degrade a person&#x2019;s work, to compromise or corrupt its value. There is still genuine and enthralling knowledge work, but it is increasingly concentrated in the hands of an ever-�smaller elite. Even in white-�collar work, dealing in the stale abstractions of routinized spreadsheets and cost-�benefit calculation is not the same as thinking. And at low or medium wages, &#x201c;creative&#x201d; work is mainly an illusion cultivated by upper management, who tend to &#x201c;push details down and pull credit up.&#x201d; (Think of &#x201c;employees&#x201d; versus &#x201c;associates.&#x201d;) Crawford thus encourages a return to trades work. In chapter 9, I&#x2019;ll suggest a different upshot: we should move to a shorter, more flexible workweek that leaves more time for engaged leisure, whether in surfing or motorcycle repair.<br><br><b>Surfers Do Know Something</b><br><br>Surfing came into its own as a cultural phenomenon in the 1960s, when it became iconic of and to the counterculture. Surfers seemed to be onto something, something that exposed the limitations of a stagnant conformism. Timothy Leary, the 1960s-�era acid-�dropping, hippie-�boosting psychologist, tried to explain. Surfers, he said, are &#x201c;truly advanced people&#x201d; who are &#x201c;evolutionary&#x201d; for their general appreciation of waves and change. &#x201c;Many, perhaps most, surfers have become almost mystics,&#x201d; he claimed. For the surfing act is &#x201c;almost Taoist poetry. Almost Einsteinian.&#x201d;<br><br>Only &#x201c;almost,&#x201d; but even that may be a lot to expect from profoundly vague contemplation over tacos. Very few surfers are completely oblivious, let alone disrespectful and constantly stoned. And few are hippies nowadays; most work, and anyway aren&#x2019;t after the sort of freedom that licenses anything whatever, while going wherever. The times, they are still a-changin&#x2019;, and Leary&#x2019;s &#x201c;question authority,&#x201d; &#x201c;turn on, tune in, drop out&#x201d; countercultural era has passed. Change brought the triumph of capitalism over surf culture or, rather, enterprising surfers into big business, the surf industry, with clothing and wet suit sales, branding, and professional surfing. These days, most surfers are neither neo-�hippie heroes nor deadbeats but conformists, more or less. Just as many non-�surfers live for their work, serious surfers live in dedicated pursuit of excellence in a particular exercise of skill, by way of faithful daily practice, before or after work.<br><br>Surfers do know something, even if they couldn&#x2019;t be consulted for the oracular wisdom of the Stoic sage or the Zen master. The main preoccupation of the surfer is not wisdom but waves and surfing them, and the last swell, and the swell coming in the next days, whatever this might ultimately mean. A few surfers are charming and silver-�tongued, like Shaun Tomson, a former world champion. And of course there&#x2019;s Kelly Slater, the undisputed best surfer ever, who despite two decades of win-�if-�I-�feel-�like-�it competitive dominance, his nth world title, and steady progression into his forties, long after most pros retire, also happens to be a thoughtful, articulate, nice guy. Yet zoologically speaking, the global tribe of surfers is motley and carnivalesque. It&#x2019;s a mix of kids, professionals, beach people, and working-�class types, united only by the zealous love of waves, with varying interests and aptitudes in everything else.</p><h2>Swag: Southern Women Aging Gracefully</h2><p>Based on Melinda Thompson&#39;s monthly mailing, SWAG is a collection of humorous essays about the events in the life of a Southern woman, aging gracefully.</p><p>Melinda Rainey Thompson has a B.A. in English from Tulane University and an M.A. in English from the University of Alabama-Birmingham.

His early years were spent in Lancashire and Hampshire. He left school at sixteen to work as a local government clerk until being called up for army service in 1941, and spent the following four and a half years with the Royal Corps of Signals, in Gibraltar, North Africa, Italy, and Austria. </p><p> On leaving the army he renewed a teenage ambition toward being a writer, and in 1947, on the basis of an unfinished novel, won an Atlantic Award, sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, which enabled him to devote himself to writing for a year. He tried to justify the award by writing serious novels, but subsequently also wrote detective thrillers, light comedies, novels based on cricket, and science fiction, to which he had been passionately devoted in his early teens. After several adult science fiction novels, he was asked to write for the young adult field, and ended up writing sixteen books in that genre, including <i>The Guardians, The Lotus Caves, Dom and Va, Empty World,</i> and the Sword and Fireball trilogies, as well as the Tripods trilogy. Following a BBC television series in 1984 based on the Tripods books, he wrote a prequel, <i>When the Tripods Came,</i> explaining how it all came about. </p><p> Sam Youd is a widower with five children and numerous grandchildren, and lives in Rye, in the county of Sussex, England.</p><p><br> Chapter One: A Plan of Action </p><p><br> Everywhere there was the sound of water. In places it was no more than a faint whisper, heard only because of the great stillness all around; in others, an eerie distant rumbling, like the voice of a giant talking to himself in the bowels of the earth. But there were places also where its rushing was clear and loud, and the actual torrent was visible by the light of oil lamps, flinging itself down dark rocky water-courses or spilling in a fall over a sheer edge of stone. And places where the water lay calm in long black reaches, its sound muted to a monotonous drip...drip...drip...which had continued for centuries and would continue for as many more. </p><p> I was relieved from guard to go to the conference, and so went through the dimly lit tunnels late and alone. The work of nature here mingled with the work of man. The earth's convulsions, and the action of long-dead rivers, had hollowed out these caverns and channels in the limestone hills, but there were marks of the ancients, too. Men had been here in the past, smoothing uneven floors, widening narrow gaps, sinking handrails into an artificial stone to aid and guide the traveler. There were also long ropelike cables, which had once carried the power called electricity to light bulbs of glass along the way. Our wise men, Beanpole had told me, had learned the means of doing this again, but needed resources that were not available to them here -- nor would be, perhaps, while men were forced to skulk like rats in the dark corners of a world governed by the Tripods, those huge metal monsters who strode on three giant legs across the face of the earth. </p><p> I have told already how I left my native village, at the urging of a strange man who called himself Ozymandias. This happened during the summer which was to have been my last before I was presented for the Capping ceremony. In that, boys and girls in their fourteenth year were taken up into one of the Tripods and returned later wearing Caps -- a metal mesh that fitted close to the skull and made the wearer utterly obedient to our alien rulers. There were always a few whose minds broke under the strain of Capping, and these became Vagrants, men who could not think properly and who wandered aimlessly from place to place. Ozymandias had posed as one of them. In fact, his mission was to recruit people who would fight against the Tripods. </p><p> So I went, with my cousin Henry who also lived in my village, and later with Beanpole, a long journey to the south. (His real name was Jean-Paul, but we nicknamed him Beanpole because he was so tall and thin.) We arrived at last at the White Mountains, where we found the colony of free men Ozymandias had spoken of. From there, the following year, three of us were sent as a spearhead to penetrate into the City from which the Tripods came and learn what we could of them. Not quite the same three, however. Henry was left behind, and in his place we had Fritz, a native of the land of the Germans in which the City stood. He and I had got into the City, served as slaves of the Masters -- monstrous three-legged, three-eyed reptilian creatures who came from a distant star -- and learned something of their nature and their plans. But only I had escaped, plunging through the drain of the City into a river, and from there being rescued by Beanpole. We had waited, hoping Fritz might do the same, until, with snow falling and winter coming on, we had been forced to return, heavyhearted, to the White Mountains. </p><p> We had reached them to find that the colony had moved. This had been the result of a prudent decision by Julius, our leader. He had foreseen the possibility of our being unmasked by the enemy, and of our minds being ransacked once we were helpless in their grasp. So, without telling us of it, the plan had been formed to evacuate the Tunnel in the White Mountains, leaving only a few scouts to await our hoped-for return. The scouts had discovered Beanpole and myself, as we stared miserably around the deserted fortress, and had led us to the new headquarters. </p><p> This lay a long way to the east, in hilly rather than mountainous country. It was a land of narrow valleys, flanked by barren, mostly pine-wooded hills. The Capped kept to the valley floors, we to the ridges. We lived in a series of caves that ran, tortuously, for miles through the heights. Fortunately there were several entrances. We had guards on them all, and a plan for evacuation in case of attack. But so far all had been quiet. We raided the Capped for food, but were careful to have our raiding parties travel a long way from home before they pounced. </p><p> Now Julius had called a conference and I, as the only person who had seen the inside of the City -- seen a Master face to face -- was summoned from guard duty to attend it. </p><p><br> In the cave where the conference was held, the roof arched up into a darkness that our weak lamps could not penetrate: we sat beneath a cone of night in which no star would ever shine. Lamps flickered from the walls, and there were more on the table, behind which Julius sat with his advisers on roughly carved wooden stools. He rose to greet me as I approached, although any physical action caused him discomfort, if not pain. He had been crippled in a fall as a child, and was an old man now, white-haired, but red-cheeked from the long years he had spent in the thin bright air of the White Mountains. </p><p> "Come and sit by me, Will," he said. "We are just starting." It was a month since Beanpole and I had come here. At the outset I had told all I knew to Julius and others of the Council and handed over the things -- samples of the Masters' poisonous green air, and water from the City -- which I had managed to bring with me. I had expected some kind of swift action, though I did not know what. Swift, I thought, it had to be. One thing I had been able to tell them was that a great ship was on its way, across space, from the home world of the Masters, carrying machines that would turn our earth's atmosphere into air which they could breathe naturally, so that they would not have to stay inside the protective domes of the Cities. Men, and all other creatures native to the planet, would perish as the choking green fog thickened. In four years, my own Master had said, it would arrive, and the machines would be set up. There was so little time. </p><p> Julius might have been speaking to me, answering my doubts. He said, "Many of you are impatient, I know. It is right that you should be. We all know how tremendous a task we face, and its urgency. There can be no excuse for action unnecessarily delayed, time wasted. Every day, hour, minute counts. </p><p> "But something else counts as much or more; and that is forethought. It is <i>because</i> events press so hard on us that we must think and think again before we act. We cannot afford many false moves -- perhaps we cannot afford any. Therefore your Council has deliberated long and anxiously before coming to you with its plans. I will give you them in broad detail now, but each one of you has an individual part to play, and that will be told you later." </p><p> He stopped, and I saw that someone in the semicircle in front of the table had risen to his feet. Julius said, "Do you wish to speak, Pierre? There will be opportunity later, you know." </p><p> Pierre had been on the Council when we first came to the White Mountains. He was a dark, difficult man. Few men opposed Julius, but he had done so. He had, I had learned, been against the expedition to the City of Gold and Lead, and against the decision to move from the White Mountains. In the end, he had left the Council, or been expelled from it; it was difficult to be sure which. He came from the south of France, from the mountains which border on Spanish land. He said, "What I have to say, Julius, is better said first than last." </p><p> Julius nodded. "Say it, then." </p><p> "You talk of the Council coming to us with its plans. You talk of parts to play, of men being told what they must do. I would remind you, Julius; it is not Capped men you are talking to, but free. You should rather come to us asking than ordering. It is not only you and your Councillors who can plan how to defeat the Tripods. There are others who are not lacking in wisdom. All free men are equal, and must be given the rights of equality. Common sense as well as justice demands this." </p><p> He stopped speaking, but remained on his feet, among the more than a hundred who squatted on the bare rock. Outside it was winter, with even these hills mantled with snow, but, as in the Tunnel, we were protected by our thick blanket of rock. The temperature never changed here, from one day or season to another. Nothing changed here. </p><p> Julius paused for a moment, before he said, "Free men may govern themselves in different ways. Living and working together, they must surrender some part of their freedom. The difference between us and the Capped is that we surrender it voluntarily, gladly, to the common cause, while their minds are enslaved to alien creatures who treat them as cattle. There is another difference, also. It is that, with free men, what is yielded is yielded for a time only. It is done by consent, not by force or trickery. And consent is something that can always be withdrawn." </p><p> Pierre said, "You talk of consent, Julius, but where does your authority lie? In the Council. And who appoints the Council? The Council itself does, under your control. Where is the freedom there?" </p><p> "There will be a time," Julius said, "for us to discuss among ourselves how we shall be governed. That day will come when we have destroyed those who now govern humanity all over the world. Until then, we have no room for squabbling or dispute." </p><p> Pierre began to say something, but Julius raised a hand and silenced him. </p><p> "Nor do we have room for dissension, or the suspicion of dissension. Perhaps what you have said was worth saying, whatever the motive with which you said it. Consent, among free men, is given and can be withdrawn. It can also be affirmed. So I ask: will any man who wishes to challenge the authority of the Council, and its right to speak for this community, rise to his feet?" </p><p> He stopped. There was silence in the cave, apart from the shuffle of a foot and the unending distant roar of water. We waited and watched for a second man to get to his feet. None did. When time enough had gone by, Julius said, "You lack support, Pierre." </p><p> "Today. But perhaps not tomorrow." </p><p> Julius nodded. "You do well to remind me. So I will ask for something else. I ask you now to approve this Council as your government until such a time as those who call themselves the Masters are utterly defeated." He paused. "Will those in favor stand up?" </p><p> This time, all stood. Another man, an Italian called Marco, said, "I vote the expulsion of Pierre, for opposing the will of the community." </p><p> Julius shook his head. "No. No expulsions. We need every man we have, every man we can get. Pierre will do his part loyally -- I know that. Listen. I will tell you what we plan. But first I would like Will here to talk to you of what it is like inside the City of our enemies. Speak, Will." </p><p> When I had told my story to the Council, I had been asked by them to keep silent to others for the time being. Normally this would not have been easy. I am talkative by nature, and my head was full of the wonders I had seen inside the City -- the wonders, and the horrors. My mood, though, had not been normal. On the way back, with Beanpole, my energies had been taken up by the arduousness and uncertainty of the journey: there had been little time in which to brood. But after we had come to the caves it had been different. In this world of perpetual lamp-lit night, of echoing silences, I could think and remember, and feel remorse. I found I had no wish to talk to others of what I had seen, and what had happened. </p><p> Now, under Julius's instruction to speak, I found myself in confusion. I spoke awkwardly, with many stops and repetitions, at times almost incoherently. But gradually, as I continued with my story, I became aware of how closely they were all listening to it. As I went on, also, I was carried away by my recollection of that terrible time -- of what it had been like to struggle under the intolerable burden of the Masters' heavier gravity, sweating in the unvarying heat and humidity, watching fellow slaves weaken and collapse under the strain, and knowing this would almost certainly be my own fate in the end. As it had been Fritz's. I spoke, Beanpole told me later, with passion and with a fluency that was not naturally mine. When I had finished and sat down, there was a silence in my audience that told how deeply the story had affected them. </p><p> Then Julius spoke again. </p><p> "I wanted you to listen to Will for several reasons. One is that what he says is the report of someone who has actually witnessed the things of which he tells. You have heard him, and you know what I mean: what he has described to you he has seen. Another reason is to hearten you. The Masters are possessed of tremendous power and strength. They have traveled the unimaginable distances that lie between the stars. Their lives are so long that ours, by comparison, seem like the dance of mayflies for a brief day over a tumbling river. And yet..." </p><p> He paused, and looked at me with a little smile. </p><p> "And yet Will, an ordinary boy, no brighter than most, a trifle on the small side -- Will has struck at one of these monsters, and seen it collapse and die. He was lucky, of course. There is a place where they are vulnerable to a blow, and he was fortunate enough to discover it and to strike there. The fact remains that he killed one of them. They are not all-powerful. We can take heart from that. What Will managed by luck, we can achieve by planning and resolution. </p><p> "This leads me to my third point, my third reason for wanting you to hear Will's story. It is that essentially it is a story of failure." He was looking at me, and I felt myself flushing. He went on, calmly and unhurriedly: "The Master was made suspicious by finding in Will's room the notes he had made about the City and its dwellers. Will did not think the Master would go into his room, where he would have to wear a mask to be able to breathe; but this was shallow thinking. After all, he knew his Master was one who took more care of his slaves than most, and knew that he had, before his own time, arranged for small extra comforts to be installed in the refuge room. It was reasonable that he might do so again, and find the book with notes in it." </p><p> His tone was level, considering rather than critical, but the more damning for that. My shame and embarrassment grew as I listened to him. </p><p> "Will was able, with Fritz's help, to salvage a great deal from the situation. He escaped from the City, and returned with information whose value to us is beyond computing. But still more could have been gained." His eyes were on me again. "And with time to plan things better, Fritz might have come back, too. He passed on to Will as much as he could of what he had learned, but it would have been better if he had been able to testify himself. Because every tiny item counts in the struggle." </p><p> Julius spoke...</p></p><h2>Abandon (Cold Ridge, 6)</h2><p>On what is supposed to be a quiet long weekend in<br>New Hampshire, Deputy U.S. Marshal Mackenzie Stewart<br>is viciously attacked at the lakefront cottage of her friend,<br>federal judge Bernadette Peacham.

Harris Mayer, the would&#x2013;be informant who had set up this meeting.<br> <br>If they switched drinks, Rook thought, maybe Harris would choke on the lemon seed.<br> <br>They were sitting along the back wall of a quiet bar in an upscale hotel four blocks from the White House. In his day, Harris had served two presidents. But it wasn't his day anymore. He was an outcast, caught five years ago in a gambling scandal that had cost him his job and his reputation, if not his trust fund or his freedom. Many people&#x2013;including Rook&#x2014;believed criminal charges should have been filed against him, but Harris, once a federal judge, had managed to skate.<br> <br>"We've been here a half hour," Rook said. "Get to the point."<br> <br>Harris ran a pinkish fingertip along the rim of his beer glass. He was sixty&#x2013;nine but looked older. His hands were trembling and heavily veined, a wet cough sporadically rattling his thin frame. Brown spots and moles dotted his fair, finely wrinkled skin and showed through his thin white hair. He wore a starched shirt and a sport coat with one of his ubiquitous bow ties, and his wingtip shoes were polished but had just enough sign of wear to suggest he was a man, nonetheless, who still got around Washington&#x2014;who still mattered.<br> <br>Lifting his beer, Harris gave a paternalistic tut&#x2013;tut. "You have a short fuse, Special Agent Rook."<br> <br>"You might want to keep that in mind."<br> <br>"I chose you because you're a rising star with the Bureau. You're familiar with fraud and corruption investigations." Harris spoke with a nasal, affected patrician voice.<br> <br>"You need to learn patience."<br> <br>Rook grabbed his glass and took a long drink. He didn't care if he swallowed the damn lemon seed. <i>Patience.</i> he'd been patient. For three weeks, he'd played Harris's game, treating seriously his vague tale of Washington intrigue, blackmail and extortion. Financial shenanigans. Sordid secrets. Fraud. Possible conspiracy. Harris Mayer knew all the buttons to push to get and keep Rook's attention.<br> <br>Now it was time for results. So far, Harris had produced nothing of substance, and Rook couldn't waste any more time indulging an old man's fantasies of regaining lost prestige, being a player again.<br> <br>He set down his glass, hard. Harris didn't seem to notice. Rook wore a dark gray suit, not a cheap one, but not as expensive as most of the suits the other men in the bar had on, including his wannabe informant. Rook hadn't worn a bow tie since first grade.<br> <br>"Are we waiting for someone to show up?" he asked.<br> <br>"Ah. There we are. The federal agent at work, applying his deductive reasoning to the situation at hand." Harris licked his thin lips. "Of <i>course</i> we're waiting for someone to show up."<br> <br>Rook considering shoving the lemon seed up Harris's nose. "When?"<br> <br>"Anytime now."<br> <br>"Here?"<br> <br>Harris shook his head. "Observe the guests walking up the hall to the ballroom. Beautifully dressed, aren't they? I still have my tuxedo. I haven't worn it in a long time."<br> <br>Rook ignored the small play for sympathy. The table Harris had chosen provided a strategic view of everyone in the bar, as well as everyone who passed by in the gleaming, glittering hall. About two hundred guests were gathering in the ballroom for a cocktail reception to benefit a local literacy organization. Rook had recognized a number of high&#x2013;powered guests, but no one involved&#x2014;at least as far as he knew&#x2014;in criminal activity.<br> <br>Harris could call the shots tonight. He was the informant. It was his show.<br> <br>"There's Judge Peacham." The old judge almost chortled as he gestured toward the hall, smiling as if he were in possession of a secret that confirmed his natural superiority. "I knew she'd be here." "Why do I care if Judge Peacham is at a charity function?"<br> <br>"Just wait."<br> <br>"Mr. Mayer&#x2014;"<br> <br>"Judge," he corrected with a sniff. "It's still appropriate to refer to me as Judge Mayer."<br> <br>"Seeing Judge Peacham again doesn't help me."<br> <br>"Shh. Patience. We might have to go into the hall. I hope not&#x2014;I'd prefer Bernadette not see me."<br> <br>Bernadette Peacham paused in the hall just outside the bar, her attention focused on something&#x2014;or someone&#x2014;behind her. For the past ten years, she'd served as a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Before that, she'd been a federal prosecutor and a partner in a prestigious Washington law firm. But her roots were in New Hampshire, where she owned a lake house that had been in her family for more than a hundred years. She often told people she planned to die there, as her parents and her grandfather had.<br> <br>Rook had done research on Judge Peacham, and he'd testified in her courtroom a half&#x2013;dozen times in the three years since he'd worked out of the Washington Field Office. He didn't know if she'd recognize him if she walked into the bar, but she'd sure as hell recognize J. Harris Mayer, the old friend who had lured her to Washington thirty years ago.<br> <br>She'd never win any awards for best&#x2013;dressed judge, Rook thought with amusement. Tonight's outfit looked as if she'd pulled it out of a paper bag stuffed under her desk in her chambers. Apart from the obvious wrinkles, the black floor&#x2013;length dress and brightly colored sequined shawl somehow didn't go together. Not that Rook had an eye for clothes, but Bernadette Peacham was a train wreck when it came to style. No Botox and face&#x2013;lifts for her. No hair dye, for that matter. Damn little makeup, either. People tended to notice her because of her presence and her obvious intelligence and grace. At fifty&#x2013;seven, she was regarded as a firm, fair, articulate trial judge and, despite her generous nature, no one's fool.<br> <br>She was perhaps Harris Mayer's last friend in the world, not that he would let friendship or anything else stop him from feeding her to the wolves.<br> <br>Or, if it came to it, the FBI.<br> <br>Harris would calculate the benefit to himself and act accordingly.<br> <br>Rook drank more of his water, although he was only a notch less impatient than he'd been five minutes ago. "It looks like she might be expecting someone to join her. A date?"<br> <br>"Oh, no." Harris shook his head as if Rook couldn't have come up with a dumber idea. "She hasn't started dating again since her divorce was finalized earlier this month. Cal still lives with her, you know. Don't you think that's odd?"<br> <br>"Maybe it was an amicable divorce."<br> <br>"No such thing."<br> <br>Her marriage to Cal Benton, a prominent Washington attorney, had surprised people far more than their divorce two years later. It was her second marriage; her first, to another lawyer, had lasted three years. No children. "Supposedly he's not getting a dime from her," Harris continued, his voice more shrill now, as if he was growing impatient himself. "That can't make him happy, but it doesn't matter&#x2014;Cal will never be satisfied. He'll always want more of everything. Money, recognition, women. Whatever. For some people, there's never enough. Cal is one of them. <i>I'm </i>one of them."<br> <br>"I can't launch an investigation because you think Bernadette Peacham deserved better than Cal Benton&#x2014;"<br> <br>"I'm well aware of what you require to proceed." Harris regarded the woman in the hall with a sudden, almost palpable sadness. She'd been a prot�g�e, and she'd left him in the dust in terms of her career, her reputation, her ever&#x2013;widening circle of friends. His expression softened and he said quietly, "We're not here because of Bernadette's love life or lack thereof."<br> <br>Rook didn't respond. Harris had lived in social and professional exile for a long time, but, as prickly as he was, he was observant, experienced and very smart. He had a long career behind him, and even now, people owed him favors and came to him, quietly, for advice.<br> <br>He gave Rook a supercilious smile. "Thinking you'd be smart not to underestimate me, aren't you?"<br> <br>"I'm thinking you need to get to the point."<br> <br>Harris leaned over the small table and said in a dramatic whisper, "Don't forget. I know where a lot of the bodies in this town are buried." He sat back abruptly and grinned, his teeth yellowed from age, cigarettes, drink and neglect.<br> <br>"Figuratively speaking, of course."<br> <br>Rook sucked in his impatience. "If you're looking for action at my expense, Judge, you're looking in the wrong place."<br> <br>"Understood." Harris nodded wistfully at the middle&#x2013;aged woman in the hall. "Bernadette used to stop by my office just to say hello, grab a cup of coffee. We don't see each other that often nowadays."<br> <br>"It's to her credit she didn't drop you altogether."<br> <br>"I suppose it is. Ah. Here we are." Harris seemed relieved. "Finally."<br> <br>Another woman came into their line of sight.<br> <br>Rook took in her dark red hair, her big smile as she greeted Bernadette Peacham.<br> <br><i>Hell.</i><br> <br>Harris's eyes lit up. "Mackenzie Stewart," he said with relish.<br> <br>She was barely thirty and slim, wearing a slip of a deep blue and carrying an evening purse just big enough for a <br>.38 caliber pistol. Rook didn't know women's purses. But he knew guns.<br> <br>"She's a deputy U.S. marshal," Harris added. "A fugitive hunter, a protector of the federal judiciary. A fellow federal agent. Doesn't look like Wyatt Earp, does she?"<br> <br>Rook kept his reaction under tight wraps. He wasn't there to entertain Harris. "All right. You've had your fun. What's going on?"<br> <br>The old man's eyes lost some of their spark. "Deputy Stewart isn't here in a professional capacity. She's not protecting Bernadette. In fact, she's known Bernadette all her life."<br> <br><i>Well, hell,</i> Rook thought. A half&#x2013;dozen dates, and more or less all he'd learned about Mackenzie was that she was new in Washington, new to the Marshals Service and a native New Englander blessed with great legs, a kissable mouth and an unstoppable sense of humor.<br> <br>They hadn't gotten around to discussing which state she was from and what friends she might have in Washington.<br> <br>The two women continued on down the hall toward the ballroom.<br> <br>"Bernadette saved her," Harris said.<br> <br>"Saved her how?"<br> <br>"When she was eleven, her father was maimed in a terrible accident while building a shed for Bernadette at her lake house. He was laid up for months, and Mackenzie was left on her own for much of the time. She got into trouble. Stole things. She blamed herself for what happened."</p><h2>One Year Bible Story Book</h2><p>An excellent read-to-me book.

Right, Jim Flora (1914-98) <i>is</i> the guy, the one who made those astonishingly energetic early LP cartoon-art covers, on which, for instance, jazzmen were playing so hot that their bodies flew apart like unstrung marionettes or, at the other extreme, melted together (apparently not altogether pleasantly: look at those bristling teeth on <i>Inside Sauter-Finnegan</i>). A drawer from childhood on, Flora turned to commercial art after giving up, for financial reasons, an architecture scholarship. He forged his distinctive style as the artist for a little magazine that he and another literarily inclined student put out on a shoestring. Cubism, Miro, Klee, and, especially after a year and a half in Mexico at midcentury, the great muralists Orozco, Rivera, and Siqueiros, influenced Flora; a further great Mexican, Covarrubias, who did a lot of commercial art himself, shows in the poses and contours of Flora's figures. Flora characteristically used four or fewer colors--bright, even pastels that, with the sharpness of his line, make his drawings suggest linocuts. His work virtually always provokes a smile, and pop-culture preservationist-revivalist Chusid accompanies a tidy gallery of it with his own and others' writing about and interviews with Flora.

But the intervening years have given the bestselling author and syndicated columnist some of the best raw material a political writer could ask for. The Republicans staged a revolution, Clinton was reelected, welfare "deform" swept the country, and the militia movement came out of the bunker: in short, it's been a banner time for Molly's brand of shoot-from-the-hip commentary and uproarious anecdotes. <br><br>You Got to Dance with Them What Brung You brings together a first-class collection of smart, spirited, and fiercely funny writings. From the wild and woolly politics of her native Texas to the waffling in the Oval Office, Molly exposes the fatuous and hypocritical at all levels of public life. Whether she's writing about the 1996 presidential candidates ("Dole contributed perhaps the funniest line of the year with his immortal observation that tobacco is not addictive but that too much milk might be bad for us. The check from the dairy lobby must have been late that week"), conspiracy theorists ("Twenty-five years in the newspaper bidness have given me a fairly strong faith in the proposition that if you haven't read about it in The Daily Disappointment or seen it on the network news, it's probably not true"), or cultural trends ("I saw a restaurant in Seattle that specialized in latte and barbecue. Barbecue and latte. I came home immediately"), Molly&nbsp;&nbsp;takes on the issues of the day with her trademark good sense and inimitable wit. <br><br>"I can think of few causes more important than keeping free voices alive in a world of corporate media," Molly writes. She is one&nbsp;&nbsp; of those voices and a national treasure; as the Los Angeles Times put it, she is "H. L. Mencken without the cruelty, Will Rogers with an agenda." Whatever your political persuasion, you're bound to agree that Molly Ivins is one of the sharpest and most original commentators on the American scene today.</p><p>In this, her third volume, Molly Ivins (columnist, NPR commentator, and three-time finalist for the Pulitzer Prize) sheds light on the "great clouds of obsfucation" that stymie attempts to clearly analyze President Clinton's job performance. Ivins stayed a Clinton supporter after most of her fellow liberals bailed--up until 1996, when Clinton signed the welfare "reform" bill. "My expectations of Democratic politicians exceed my expectations of Republicans by only the smallest of margins," Ivins states ruefully, "but real Democrats don't hurt children. Clinton did." Nevertheless, current Clinton bashing defies logic and she provides a levelheaded analysis of the wave of anti-Clinton sentiment by distinguishing between the usual brew of Republican and Democrat animosity and such phenomena as "the well-financed propaganda machine funded largely by Richard Mellon Scaife of Pittsburgh."<p> The title flushes out the core concern of the collection. One of the oldest sayings in politics, "You got to dance with them what brung you," points to the reality that special-interest money rules today's politics. For Ivins, the centerpiece of corruption is gold, and such inevitable consequences as the tax burden shifting from corporations to individuals; the widening gap between rich and poor. <i>You've Got to Dance with Them What Brung You</i>, inimitably bold and broad, attacks racism, homophobia, terrorism; offers a terse and dismally delightful excoriation of the "ineffable" Newt Gingrich; reports on political farces at both the state and national levels. It's full of incisive gems that offer insight on some of our national extremes (Timothy McVeigh's obsession with the bizarre and racist book, <i>The Turner Diaries</i>, replete with the bomb recipe that blew up the Murrah Federal Building).</p><p> Champion of commonsense and compassion; frank and boldly funny, Molly Ivins has been called by the <i>L.A. Times</i> "H.L. Mencken without the cruelty, Will Rogers with an agenda." Those of us who love Molly Ivins read her for her gutsy, lively, liberal values, and those of us who don't ... should.</p>Praise for You Got to Dance with Them What Brung You<br><br>"Thank you, Jesus! Here comes Molly with another power-packed volume to cure what ails you. My no-fail prescription for personal and political health is to take a vitamin E capsule once a day, an evening constitutional, at least a couple of twelve-ounce elbow bends, and a daily dose of Molly Ivins.

What's so impressive is the way she applies it to herself, and her absolute faith and belief that we can all do better."<br>--Senator Paul D. Wellstone (D-Minnesota)<br><br>"This book is not for everyone. If you're a politician who bruises easily or you love one who does, forget it.

Lomax--of the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress, Alan Lomax traveled the South &#34;from the Brazos bottoms of Texas to the tidewater country of Virginia&#34; in search of the wellspring of American blues. Previously the author of Mister Jelly Roll, Lomax stalks the ghosts of Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Big Bill Broonzy and Charlie Patton, among many other blues pioneers. This winner of the 1993 National Book Critics Circle Award for General Nonfiction is more than just another profile of a musical genre. It&#39;s an intimate diary of a purely American art form born of a powerful mix of despair and hope.Set in an era as harsh and fertile as Delta silt, <i>The Land Where The Blues Began</i> reveals how the river of African American culture overtook its repressive banks--to give us R &amp; B, soul, rock 'n' roll, and the only purely American art form, the blues. Alan Lomax takes us on an adventure into the "bad old days" of the post-slavery, Kim Crow Mississippi Delta--the birthplace of the blues--when railroads and levees were being built and cotton boomed at the expense of Southern working-class African Americans. Singing of their misery and their barely concealed rage, the Bluesman enlisted their African heritage to keep their souls alive and in the process created the first satirical song form in the English language. We meet Muddy Waters (the father of modern blues), learn how Robert Johnson met his end, and are introduced to Fred McDowell and Son House, who taught Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton how to play the blues.<p></p><p>"If not for Lomax, few people would have heard 'Tom Dooley' or 'Goodnight Irene, and Bob Zimmerman might be singing 'Feelings' at Holiday Inns around Hibbing, Minnesota."--<i>Newsweek</i></p></p><h2>Entering Hades: The Double Life of a Serial Killer</h2><p><i>"I was a greedy, ravenous individual, determined to rise from the bottom to the top . . . It wasn't me!"--Jack Unterweger's final words to his jury</i><i></i>&nbsp;Serial killers rarely travel internationally. So in the early 1990s, when detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department began to find bodies of women strangled with their own bras, it didn't occur to them at first to make a connection with the bodies being uncovered in the woods outside of Vienna, Austria. &nbsp;The LAPD waited for the killer to strike again. Meanwhile, in Austria, the police followed what few clues they had. The case intrigued many reporters, but few as keenly as Jack Unterweger, a local celebrity. He cut a striking figure, this little man in expensive white suits. His expertise on Vienna's criminal underworld was hard-earned. He had been sentenced to life in jail as a young man. But while incarcerated, he began to write--and his work earned him the glowing attention of the literary elite. The intelligentsia lobbied for his release and by 1990, Jack was free again. He continued writing, nurturing his career as a journalist. But though he now traveled in the highest circles, he had a secret life. He was killing again, and in the greatest of ironies, reporting on the very crimes he had committed. &nbsp;With unprecedented access to Jack's diaries and letters, John Leake peels back the layers of deception to reveal the life and crimes of Jack Unterweger, and in unnerving detail, exposes the thrilling twists--both in the United States and Europe--that led to Jack's capture and Austria's "trial of the century."</p><p><b>John Leake&nbsp;</b>was born in Dallas, Texas, and earned his MA in philosophy at Boston University. After winning a fellowship at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna, he lived there on and off for six years, working as a translator and editor. This is his first book.Chapter 1&nbsp;On July 11, 1991, a solar eclipse occurred in the sky over Los Angeles. At 10:12 a.m., the moon began to move in front of the sun, and by 11:28 it covered 69 percent of it. That morning, a couple of men and their children drove up to Corral Canyon Road in Malibu, northwest of the city, to watch the event.<br>&nbsp;The Malibu hills are a landscape of rugged beauty, hostile to residential development. During the dry season the resinous brush, desiccated by the Santa Ana wind, sometimes sparks into swift-moving conflagrations that incinerate everything in their path. About two miles inland, an old fire road branches off to the right of Corral Canyon Road and ascends a steep hill. With its panoramic view and isolation, the grassy mesa at the top draws the occasional couple seeking the thrill of sex under an open sky. A few empty wine bottles and discarded underwear bear witness to their encounters.<br>&nbsp;The men and children were seeking the mesa&#x2019;s high vantage point to watch the eclipse, but as they reached the top, they were too horrified by what they saw lying on the ground to pay attention to the sky. When they called the L.A. County Sheriff&#x2019;s Department at 11:15 a.m., the first man to talk said he&#x2019;d discovered a dead body, but as he started to give directions to its location, he became upset and started cursing. A calmer man then got on the phone and described where the body lay, and a couple of hours later, Deputy Sheriff Ronnie Lancaster was directed to the scene.<br>&nbsp;A cheerful native of Amarillo, Texas, Lancaster had seen much of the evil that men do, but he seldom allowed it to put him in a bad humor. Bodies shot and stabbed were part of the territory, and like all good detectives, he&#x2019;d trained his mind to view them as evidence, not as the personalities they once were. The one thing he&#x2019;d never gotten used to was decomposition. When the call came in about a murdered woman off Corral Canyon Road, Lancaster didn&#x2019;t ask for a description of the crime scene, as he always preferred to approach it without preconceived notions. But he did have one question: &#x201c;Is it a decomp?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Yes, it is.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, man,&#x201d; he said to his partner. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a decomp. There&#x2019;s gonna be maggots, and that means I&#x2019;m gonna have nightmares.&#x201d; They arrived at the base of the fire road at 2:45 p.m.&#x2014;the hottest time of the hottest day he could remember. Reaching the top of the mesa soaked in sweat, he found the area cordoned off with a group of sheriff&#x2019;s deputies and park rangers standing around. Deputy Knudson, the first to have arrived at the scene, filled them in.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I got the call at 11:51 and headed here. An Aero unit flew over before I arrived and directed me to the site. The guys who found her called the Malibu Station, but they didn&#x2019;t say who they were or wait for me to get here. The decomp is advanced, but you can see from her breasts she&#x2019;s a female.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;The heavy-set corpse was lying on its back, twenty yards west of the dirt road, underneath a laurel sumac shrub. Her face was obscured by maggots streaming out of her nose, mouth, eyes, and ears. Her T-shirt was hiked up to her shoulders, exposing her bloated belly and breasts. Around her neck was a tightly knotted bra. Otherwise she was clothed. The pockets of her blue jeans were turned out; no I.D. was present.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Boys, we&#x2019;re gonna solve this one!&#x201d; Lancaster exclaimed. &#x201c;This is the work of a boyfriend or husband; all we gotta do is find him and case closed.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;What if it&#x2019;s a hooker?&#x201d; his partner asked.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;What would a hooker be doing up here? They take care of business a block or two from where they get picked up, and we&#x2019;ve gotta be twenty-five miles from where the nearest streetwalker would be.&#x201d; The inspectors continued working the crime scene, and at 5:20 p.m., the coroner recovery team arrived to collect the body.<br>&nbsp;Lancaster was glad the day&#x2019;s work was ending. He knew he wasn&#x2019;t done yet&#x2014;that he&#x2019;d have to go over the whole thing again with a forensic pathologist. But at least he could take a break from it. He walked over to the edge of the hill, to where the fire road began its descent to Corral Canyon Road. The view of Santa Monica Bay was spectacular, and for the first time that day he thought about the beauty of the landscape. He&#x2019;d always associated a pretty countryside with the feeling of peace. To have committed such a horrible crime in such a lovely place seemed especially perverse.<br>&nbsp;That night he had nightmares, and the next day, still feeling haggard, he bumped into Lieutenant Christianson at the Homicide Bureau.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Just heard from the coroner. They fingerprinted that girl from Corral Canyon Road, and guess what? She is a prostitute. Nice call, Lancaster.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve gotta be kidding!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;She&#x2019;s got numerous arrests on her record.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Well, what the hell was she doing up there on that hill?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s for you to find out. You can start with the coroner. The autopsy&#x2019;s tomorrow morning at eleven o&#x2019;clock.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;Autopsies didn&#x2019;t bother him too much, though it sometimes troubled him when a victim stared at him. A dead man&#x2019;s eyes don&#x2019;t close, and they may catch you in their gaze. Sherri Long didn&#x2019;t have eyes to stare at him because they&#x2019;d been eaten by maggots. In their place were empty black orbits. Lancaster felt his knees go weak as Dr. Ribe opened her skull to reveal &#x201c;a large seething central mass composed of several thousand active maggots, mostly large.&#x201d; They had devoured all of her brain except &#x201c;50 cc of pale gray soup,&#x201d; which was collected for toxicology, as well as a few live specimens of the larvae. From their species and length, a forensic entomologist could deduce how long the victim had been lying in the place where she was found, and if she had first lain somewhere else.<br>&nbsp;In Dr. Ribe&#x2019;s estimation, the victim had been dead four to seven days. &#x201c;From the anatomic findings and pertinent history,&#x201d; he ascribed the death to &#x201c;ASPHYXIA due to or as a consequence of LIGATURE STRANGULATION.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Deputy John Yarborough, the girl strangled with her bra in Malibu sounded familiar, as he&#x2019;d recently read LAPD teletypes about prostitutes who&#x2019;d been murdered in the same way downtown. He showed the printouts to Lancaster, who contacted Detective Fred Miller at LAPD Homicide. When Miller heard the story of the girl murdered in Malibu, he figured the killer he&#x2019;d been hunting had struck again.<br>&nbsp;The killer had struck first on the night of June 19, 1991. Twenty-year-old Shannon Exley was popular with the truckers who delivered groceries to the produce district off Seventh Avenue in downtown L.A. They liked her blond hair and youthful looks. Performing for them was rough and dirty work, but she needed the money to support her crack habit. On the evening of June 19, 1991, she called her father before she went to work and told him that she was trying to get her life in order.<br>&nbsp;Her last customer picked her up on Seventh sometime after midnight and drove east, across the L.A. River to the Girl Scout Center on Seventh and Fickett. In the vacant lot behind it, surrounded by eucalyptus trees, no one saw his car or heard her screams, so he could have taken all the time he wanted with her.<br>&nbsp;The location indicated he had planned the killing, because it wasn&#x2019;t a place where Seventh Avenue hookers turned tricks. Normally they drove only a block or two with their customers and parked in the neighboring warehouse district. Shannon would not have proposed driving to an isolated place, miles from her corner. The killer must have scoped it out in advance, because he wouldn&#x2019;t have spotted it at night. From where he picked her up, he knew where he was taking her, and when to slow down for the right turn into the narrow lane that dead-ended next to the wooded lot.<br>&nbsp;The killer had strangled her with her own bra. Detective Miller knew of prostitutes getting manually strangled, beat up, shot, and stabbed, but he&#x2019;d never heard of a hooker strangled with her own bra, the bra left tightly bound around her neck. Not only was it kinky, it appeared to have been practiced. Miller sensed that whoever had murdered Shannon Exley had probably murdered women before, and would probably do so again.&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller had known from a young age that he wanted to be a detective. Raised in San Antonio, Texas, he moved with his family to L.A. when he was in high school. After a stint in the U.S. Army, with a tour of duty in Vietnam, he joined the LAPD. Those were the days of the television series Dragnet and Adam-12, when its officers had a reputation for being the best in the world. Only the toughest and smartest cops could police a city like Los Angeles, with its giant size, ethnic complexity, large amount of crime, and chronic shortage of police manpower.<br>&nbsp;At the downtown Robbery and Homicide Division, Miller had investigated cases with legendary detectives such as John &#x201c;Jigsaw John&#x201d; St. John, Badge Number One. By the summer of 1991, he&#x2019;d probably worked on or been privy to as many serial murder investigations as any cop in the country. Over the years he&#x2019;d supplemented his experience by reading the literature on serial murder that came out of the FBI, and he attended its seminars in L.A.

As a result, antibiotic resistance now ranks among the gravest medical problems of modern times. <i>Good Germs, Bad Germs</i> addresses not only this issue but also what has become known as the "hygiene hypothesis"--&nbsp; an argument that links the over-sanitation of modern life to now-epidemic increases in immune and other disorders. In telling the story of what went terribly wrong in our war on germs, Jessica Snyder Sachs explores our emerging understanding of the symbiotic relationship between the human body and its resident microbes--which outnumber its human cells by a factor of nine to one! The book also offers a hopeful look into a future in which antibiotics will be designed and used more wisely, and beyond that, to a day when we may replace antibacterial drugs and cleansers with bacterial ones--each custom-designed for maximum health benefits.<br><br></p><p><br><br><b>Jessica Snyder Sachs</b> is a freelance science writer.

She lives in New Jersey.<br><br><br><br>Excerpt<br>On the icy afternoon of December 6, 2003, Theresa Lannetti slipped into the home-team bleachers of Person Stadium, in the wooded college town of Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Like everyone around her, she had come to cheer the Lycoming College Warriors in their NCAA division quarterfinals against the Bridgewater Eagles. But for once Theresa did not scan the crowd for the other parents with whom she&#x2019;d become friends over the previous three years. She understood that few would expect her to be there, and some might feel awkward that she was.<br>&nbsp;The previous night, in the critical-care unit of a local community hospital, Theresa had wrapped her arms around her son&#x2019;s college roommate, Sean Hennigar, telling him that he would score a touchdown for Ricky the next day. In the morning Theresa knew that she had to stay in Williamsport and lose herself in the familiar sounds of the game. She watched as Ricky&#x2019;s teammates jogged out from the locker room; she registered the clenched jaws and fists of his best friends; and then she glimpsed the 19s scrawled in eye black across their arms, sleeves, and pant legs. The cheerleaders rose to welcome the team&#x2014;more 19s, written in jagged strips of athletic tape across the backs of their jackets and with blue greasepaint on puffy cheeks streaked with tears. Theresa&#x2019;s own eyes remained dry until she looked across the field to see yet another 19, some fifteen feet tall, shoveled into the snowy hillside alongside the visitor stands. As Theresa watched, the artist put down his shovel and flopped onto his back, adding one perfect snow angel and then another&#x2014;two asterisks above her son&#x2019;s number. Perhaps they stood for the two team records that Ricky Lannetti had set that season: six pass receptions in a single game and seventy over the regular season. Overhead, the clouds began to part for the first time that week.<br>&nbsp;The first snowstorm of the winter had arrived the previous Tuesday, dusting the field as the Warriors finished afternoon practice. The forecast of weeklong blizzard conditions did not dampen the campus-wide excitement over the NCAA division quarterfinals, with expectations high that this would be the season Lycoming would advance to the semifinals, having fallen short the previous six years. Ricky had started coughing that morning, and near the end of the blustery cold practice, a wave of nausea forced him to sit out the final plays. When Theresa called from Philadelphia the next day, Ricky cut her short. &#x201c;Mom, I can&#x2019;t talk right now. I don&#x2019;t feel so good,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be fine. It&#x2019;s just one of those twenty-four-hour things. I gotta throw up now, okay?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;Theresa told herself that Ricky was probably right&#x2014;he&#x2019;d be fine by the weekend. As always, she looked forward to watching her son play and didn&#x2019;t even mind the 180-mile trip from her row-house neighborhood in northeast Philly to Williamsport, the central Pennsylvania college town where Ricky was halfway through his senior year as a criminal justice major. While Theresa&#x2019;s marriage to Ricky&#x2019;s father had ended in 1991, their son&#x2019;s sports, especially football, kept family and mutual friends bound together around practice schedules, games, and postgame celebrations. In grade school Ricky had a reputation as a &#x201c;mighty mite,&#x201d; always among the smallest on the field but also the hardest to catch or evade. Other kids his age could never understand how a guy who barely reached their shoulders could hit so damn hard or arc into the air, as if from nowhere, to snag a ball. By the time Ricky reached high school, Theresa was cheering more often than cringing when her son withstood tackles that should have brought down someone twice his size. She even begrudgingly accepted the fact that there was no way she could drag him out of a game, even when she knew he&#x2019;d been hurt. In his four years playing for Lycoming, he had missed only one game, and that for a badly twisted ankle that he insisted was fine after a week.<br>&nbsp;But the days leading up to the team&#x2019;s quarterfinal game had Theresa worried. Ricky was still throwing up when she called back on Thursday. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t ignore this!&#x201d; she insisted. &#x201c;You have to have someone check this out.&#x201d; She phoned the head trainer, Frank Neu, who promised to take Ricky to see his wife, a family physician, to rule out anything more serious than the flu that had been downing students since the Thanksgiving break. That afternoon Stacey Neu listened to Ricky&#x2019;s lungs. They sounded clear. She took his temperature&#x2014;slightly elevated. With his main symptoms being nausea, fatigue, and achiness, all signs pointed to the flu. Antibiotics wouldn&#x2019;t help, she explained, as they kill bacteria, not viruses.<br>&nbsp;The snow was still falling across Pennsylvania on Friday morning when Ricky&#x2019;s legs began to ache. His roommates, Sean Hennigar and Brian Conners, pushed sports drinks and water, figuring that Ricky was dehydrated from vomiting. That evening the snow slowed Theresa&#x2019;s drive out of Philly to a crawl. She wasn&#x2019;t yet halfway to Williamsport at 9:30 p.m. when Ricky called her cell phone to say he wanted to sleep. He&#x2019;d see her in the morning. But Ricky didn&#x2019;t sleep. And despite himself, he moaned every time he rolled over in bed. &#x201c;If I don&#x2019;t get outta here, you guys won&#x2019;t get any sleep before the game,&#x201d; he told his roommates at 4:00 a.m. He called and asked his mom to bring him to her hotel room.<br>&nbsp;Initially, Ricky rebuffed Theresa&#x2019;s suggestion that they go to the hospital. But when she heard him sound short of breath, she insisted. At 7:20 a.m. they pushed through the emergency room doors, and Ricky began vomiting blood. Within five minutes a half dozen doctors and nurses had oxygen flowing into Ricky&#x2019;s nostrils and an intravenous line infusing fluids into his left arm. They drew blood for laboratory tests and put him on a heart monitor.<br>&nbsp;The critical-care doctor in charge noted Ricky&#x2019;s rapid heart rate, low blood pressure, shortness of breath, and slightly elevated temperature. &#x201c;Just achy all over,&#x201d; Ricky told him when the doctor asked about chest or abdominal pain. &#x201c;And tired, really tired.&#x201d; Ricky&#x2019;s lungs still sounded clear. His nose and throat looked normal. The doctor asked when he last peed. &#x201c;Sometime Thursday, I think,&#x201d; Ricky replied. Theresa saw the alarm in the face of the doctor, who immediately called for a catheter. As soon as the nurse inserted it, the attached Foley bag filled with cloudy brown urine. Ricky&#x2019;s kidneys were shutting down.<br>&nbsp;Though Ricky&#x2019;s symptoms still pointed to a viral illness&#x2014;albeit an overwhelming one&#x2014;the critical-care doctor decided that he could not afford to wait for the twelve-hour blood culture that could rule out a bacterial infection. He added two powerful antibiotics&#x2014;cefepime and vancomycin&#x2014;to the fluids flowing into Ricky&#x2019;s arm. Theresa, meanwhile, had reached Ricky&#x2019;s father en route to Williamsport for the afternoon game and diverted him to the hospital. When Rick Senior arrived just before 11:00 a.m., he was stunned by the sight of his son in a tangle of tubes and wires, lips and nose still flecked with dry blood.<br>&nbsp;Back at Lycoming College, NCAA officials were trodding over the snow-blanketed playing turf and kicking at the broad mound of ice that encased midfield. At 10:00 a.m. they had announced their decision to postpone the game to Sunday rather than risk player injury. Ricky&#x2019;s closest teammates headed to the hospital, where to their surprise the emergency room staff let them walk into the intensive care unit. Ricky seemed better. Irritated with the parade of doctors in and out of his room, he wanted the oxygen line removed from his nose, and he wanted to know when he could go home. &#x201c;I heard the game was postponed,&#x201d; he told Sean. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s great. Maybe I&#x2019;ll have a chance to play.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;But just after 1:00 p.m. Ricky sank into unconsciousness, and alarms began beeping as the level of oxygen in his blood dropped dangerously low. A nurse herded the football players out of the room, as doctors snaked a tube down Ricky&#x2019;s throat so a mechanical ventilator could take over the work of his failing lungs. An echocardiogram showed that his heart was likewise weakening, and a call went out for a helicopter to fly Ricky to Philadelphia&#x2019;s Temple University Medical Center, where he could be put on a heart-assist machine. An infectious-disease specialist ordered additional antibiotics as a hedge against any conceivable type of bacterial infection. Something was destroying Ricky&#x2019;s organs, but exactly what or where it lurked in his body remained maddeningly unclear. Then came worse news: the helicopter pilot at Temple University Hospital had ruled it too dangerous to fly in the continuing snowstorm.<br>&nbsp;Ricky&#x2019;s heart stopped at 5:36 p.m. For forty minutes, nurses and doctors performed CPR as they waited for a cardiac surgeon to arrive. By 6:30, the surgeon had connected Ricky&#x2019;s arteries to a heart-lung bypass machine that circulated sixteen units of oxygenated blood through his body. But an hour later Ricky&#x2019;s heart remained still, his eyes fixed and dilated. The surgeon stepped out of the operating room to talk with Ricky&#x2019;s parents. At 7:36 p.m. he disconnected Ricky&#x2019;s machine.<br>&nbsp;Theresa asked the nurses to help her clean Ricky and move him back to his hospital room. She wanted the boys&#x2014;now sobbing in the hallways&#x2014;to see their friend once more before they left. She knew she had done the right thing when Ricky&#x2019;s father pointed out the smile on his son&#x2019;s face and linebacker Tim Schmidt added, &#x201c;Damn, if that&#x2019;s not that sm...<br><br></p><h2>Leaving Cheyenne (Southwest Landmark)</h2><p>An unforgettable tale of a love triangle that spans a generation, of a friendship that endures from dusty wagons to private planes, and of a rancher&#39;s legacy that sprawls beyond memories and land. &#34;A rarity . . . funny, wonderful, heartbreaking, exhilarating&#34;.--New York Times Book Review.

The book also features illuminating texts by insiders Bruno Bischofberger, Ronnie Cutrone, David Dalton, Kenneth Goldsmith, Ivan Karp and Peggy Phelan.What is unique about ANDY WARHOL &#34;GIANT&#34; SIZE is that it provides fascinating insight into the public and private life of Warhol and in many cases also reveals the stories behind his art works.The book provides amazing comparisons between his work and his life that have never been demonstrated visually in such a way before.For example, it not only features Warhol&#39;s famous &#34;Mao&#34; series, but also includes ephemera from a 1982 trip to China (his passport, boarding pass, a souvenir from his hotel, etc.) alongside a photo of Warhol standing in front of the Forbidden City in Beijing with an official Mao portrait in the background. This important new publication includes a staggering quantity and array of colorful material including: Warhol&#39;s birth certificate, citing Andrew Warhola&#39; was born on 8/6/28 in Pittsburgh; childhood photographs of his family; the magazine tear sheet showing the first article he illustrated for Glamour when he arrived in New York in 1949;numerous photos of Warhol with his mother; artworks for gold shoes he created in the 1950s; a letter from the MOMA dated 1959 in which the Director of the Museum&#39;s Collections rejects a work of art Warhol offered them as a gift; photographs of Warhol posing with Edie Sedgwick in a New York fashion shoot; personal letters from Mick Jagger and Liz Taylor; pictures of Warhol in the office working on Interview; pictures of Warhol private views; a series of shots of Warhol in drag; the program from his Memorial Mass on 4/1/87 and his gravestone.ANDY WARHOL &#34;GIANT&#34; SIZE is the only publication available that features Warhol&#39;s entire life, work and words in one book.The visual biography offers a behind-the-scenes look at the New York art scene of the 1950s to the 1980s, and provides a new perspective on an artist who continues to be endlessly fascinating to those inside and outside of the art world.</p><p>Dave Hickey wrote the introduction to ANDY WARHOL "GIANT" SIZE.

A work of art in itself. It's a huge, heavy, beautifully designed object, oozing class and cool from every page... May be the ultimate coffee table book."-Heat "Dazzling."-Elle Will thrill any Pop Art fan."-RA (Royal Academy of Arts) magazine "A visual feast which can be read or just perused for a fuller appreciation of the artist whose favoured style was 'to get it exactly wrong'."-The Good Book Guide "Truly astonishing... A work of art in itself, the epic portfolio has the wow factor in spades!"-Film Review</p><h2>The Land of Stories Complete Hardcover Gift Set</h2><p><b>Dive into the complete #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series The Land of Stories with this beautiful gift set.</b><br>Through the mysterious powers of a cherished book of stories, twins Alex and Conner leave their world behind and find themselves in a foreign land full of wonder and magic where they come face-to-face with the fairy tale characters they grew up reading about.<br>#1<i> New York Times </i>bestselling author Chris Colfer invites readers to join Alex and Conner on their fairy tale adventures from the beginning in this gorgeous hardcover gift set, which includes all six books in the Land of Stories series: <i>The Wishing Spell</i>, <i>The Enchantress Returns</i>, <i>A Grimm Warning</i>, <i>Beyond the Kingdoms</i>, <i>An Author's Odyssey</i>, and <i>Worlds Collide</i>.</p><p>Chris Colfer is a #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and a Golden Globe-winning actor.

The advantages of this format is to give the viewer at least three options. You can proceed chronologically from the beginning of the book to the end, thereby grasping the artist's full intent to inform, entertain and intrigue. Or you may casually thumb through the book spotting only those details that give meaning to each piece. Or you may flip the pages rapidly just to get a bird's eye view of the content. Or perhaps, you may discover some aspects of the book that we overlooked altogether. Nevertheless no matter what option a viewer chooses to take, it is our desire that each of you get so close to the piece that you see the smoke from its breath as it comes alive." &#x2015;Noah Purifoy.

Bunche (1903&#x2014;1971) began his career as an educator and a political scientist, and later joined the United Nations, serving as Undersecretary General for seventeen of his twenty-five years with that body. This African American mediator was the first person of color anywhere in the world to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace. In the mid-1930s, Bunche played a key role in organizing the National Negro Congress, a popular front-styled group dedicated to progressive politics and labor and civil rights reform.</p> <p><em>A Brief and Tentative Analysis of Negro Leadership</em> provides key insight into black leadership at the dawn of the modern civil rights movement. Originally prepared for the Carnegie Foundation study, An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy, Bunche&#x2019;s research on the topic was completed in 1940. This never-before-published work now includes an extended scholarly introduction as well as contextual comments throughout by Jonathan Scott Holloway.</p><p>Despite the fact that Malcolm X called Bunche a &#x201c;black man who didn't know his history,&#x201d; Bunche never wavered from his faith that integrationist politics paved the way for racial progress.

There have been rule books before&#x2014;stacks upon stacks of them&#x2014;but this book is unlike any other rule book you have ever read. It will not make you rich in twenty-four hours, or even seventy-two hours. It will not cause you to lose eighty pounds in a week. This book has no abdominal exercises. I have been doing abdominal exercises for most of my adult life, and my abdomen looks like it&#x2019;s always looked. It looks like flan. Syrupy flan. So we can just limit those expectations. This book does not offer a crash diet or a plan for maximizing your best self. I don&#x2019;t know a thing about your best self. It may be embarrassing. Your best self might be sprinkling peanut M&amp;M&#x2019;s onto rest-stop pizza as we speak. I cannot promise that this book is a road map to success. And we should probably set aside the goal of total happiness. There&#x2019;s no such thing.<br><br> I would, however, like for it to make you laugh. Maybe think. I believe it is possible to find, at any age, a new appreciation for what you have&#x2014;and what you don&#x2019;t have&#x2014;as well as for the people closest to you. There&#x2019;s a way to experience life that does not involve a phone, a tablet, a television screen. There&#x2019;s also a way to experience life that does not involve eating seafood at the airport, because you should really never eat seafood at the airport. <br><br> Like the title says, I want us all to achieve little victories. I believe that happiness is derived less from a significant single accomplishment than it is from a series of successful daily maneuvers. Maybe it&#x2019;s the way you feel when you walk out the door after drinking six cups of coffee, or surviving a family vacation, or playing the rowdy family Thanksgiving touch football game, or just learning to embrace that music at the gym. Accomplishments do not have to be large to be meaningful. I think little victories are the most important ones in life.&#x201d; <br><i><br>&#x2014;&nbsp;From the Introduction&nbsp;</i></p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of November 2015:</strong> Jason Gay, a popular and funny columnist for the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, was driven to write <em>Little Victories</em> after his father&#x2019;s diagnosis of cancer.

Anxious parents in particular will benefit from Gay&#x2019;s philosophy, whether it&#x2019;s his thoughts on youth sports to how to set limits on kids&#x2019; usage of digital devices: &#x201c;If it means a peaceful cross-country flight without dirty stares from every other passenger, I will let a two-year-old watch <em>Scarface</em>.&#x201d; Some chapters are laugh-out-loud funny (the family Thanksgiving chapter should be required reading at this time of year); some are poignant. All are self-deprecating and wry. There are a lot of books out there on how to stop and smell the roses.

He and his wife of over fifty years live near San Angelo, Texas, about 130 miles from where he was born and raised.Terpning's most effective paintings of the Plains Indians have an unaffected simplicity and quiet strength. Too often, however, the Arizona-based artist purveys a romanticized view of Native Americans striking noble poses. His gift for storytelling enlivens many of these pictures, such as a study of Cheyenne vision-seekers keeping a vigil in the hope that a spirit-guide will appear. Other works have ethnographic value, like the portrait of a young Cheyenne girl undergoing a ceremonial initiation into womanhood, or a depiction of Arapahos doing the Ghost Dance, a desperate mystical ritual intended to make the white man go away and the buffalo herds return. This lavishly illustrated album also features numerous historical paintings, including scenes of the Army's pursuit of Geronimo and other Apaches in 1886. In his engaging text, Kelton, a journalist and chronicler of the American West, discusses various tribes' origins, symbols, customs, child-rearing practices and the status of women. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Saving Monticello: The Levy Family&#39;s Epic Quest to Rescue the House that Jefferson Built</h2><p>Recounts the story of Jefferson&#39;s beloved estate after his heirs sold it in order to repay his debts, narrating the attempts by the Levy family to renovate the property before a foundation was established for its upkeep.</p><p><b>Marc Leepson</b> has written features and book reviews for many publications, including <i>The New York Times, Preservation, Smithsonian, The Washington Post,</i> and <i>The Sun</i> (Baltimore) and is a contributor to the <i>Encyclopedia Americana.</i> He lives with his family in Middleburg, Virginia.

Plan complicated by additions made to original building by Jefferson after his return from France. Much fine interior woodwork.</i> </p><p> Historic American Buildings Survey For Monticello, November 2, 1940 </p><p> Thomas Jefferson, the original American Renaissance man, began clearing the land atop a small mountaintop to build the house of his dreams in 1768. He was twenty-five years old. The heavily wooded land three miles outside of Charlottesville in Albemarle County, Virginia, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains was part of the thousands of acres of land he had inherited in 1764 from his father, Peter Jefferson, a self-made cartographer, surveyor, landowner, and prominent citizen of Albemarle who married into one of the most powerful colonial American families, the Randolphs of Virginia. </p><p> Thomas Jefferson was born on April 13, 1743, at Shadwell, his father's Albemarle County plantation. Since childhood Jefferson had dreamed of building a house on top of a nearby 560-foot mountain -- a radical idea at a time when most Virginia plantation homes were built in the low-lying, tobacco-growing Tidewater region. The name he selected for the site was "Monticello," Italian for hillock or small mountain. Jefferson designed the building based on his study of ancient -- particularly Roman -- architecture, and on the ideas of the great Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio (1508-1580). </p><p> Construction of Monticello began in 1769. A team of masons, carpenters, and joiners did the work. Some were white; others were Jefferson's slaves (he referred to them as "servants") who lived on the site along what became known as Mulberry Row. Jefferson himself moved to the small mountain in 1770 after Shadwell burned to the ground in a fire. </p><p> Some of the bricks and nails the workers used were forged on the mountaintop. The wood and stone used for the cellars and the columns on the East front and the limestone to make mortar came from Jefferson's own extensive estates. The window glass was imported from Europe. </p><p> Jefferson spent many years fine tuning the design for the house. In 1796 he tore up his original plans, and created new ones incorporating architectural ideas he was exposed to during the four years (1784-1789) he spent in Paris, first as American trade commissioner, and later as Minister to the Court of Louis XVI. By 1809, at the end of his second term as president when he came home from Washington to live full time at Monticello, the mansion was essentially complete. </p><p> The result was a 10,660-square-foot, twenty-room Roman neoclassical building with distinctly Jeffersonian touches. "The influence was Palladian, the immediate example was French, but viewed from any possible position Monticello was Jeffersonian," said longtime Monticello curator James A. Bear, Jr. Jefferson shaped every aspect of the house, inside and out, from the window draperies to the Windsor chairs. Jefferson packed the place with an impressive art collection, a library of books that grew to nearly seven thousand volumes in seven languages, and an enormous amount of household objects and fittings. </p><p> Most of the interior furnishings came from France in a shipment of 86 crates of furniture, silverware, glassware, china, wall paper, fabrics, books, portraits and other works of art, and household goods. As Monticello's curator Susan Stein says, during his years in France, Jefferson "shopped for a lifetime." </p><p> Included in this shipment of treasures were sixty-three paintings by different artists and seven terra-cotta plaster busts by the foremost French sculptor of the day, Jean-Antoine Houdon. Jefferson's European treasure trove also contained four dozen chairs, two sofas, six mirrors, assorted tables, four marble tabletops, and four full-length mirrors. Jefferson added more to this auspicious collection -- including eighteen chairs, six mirrors, several beds and tables -- from the top craftsmen in Williamsburg, New York, Philadelphia, and London. </p><p> Jefferson crammed Monticello's rooms with artwork, sculpture, archeological specimens, musical and scientific instruments, Indian artifacts, and <i>objets d'art</i> of all kinds. He designed features found in few homes in eighteenth-century America: two-story high ceilings, a dome -- the first on an American house -- beds tucked in alcoves, skylights, indoor "privies," extremely narrow staircases. Other one-of-a-kind interior touches included a dumbwaiter to carry wine from the cellar to the dining room and the enormous seven-day great clock framing the door of the entrance hall. </p><p> Jefferson -- the nation's third president and the man who wrote the Declaration of Independence -- was described by the Marquis de Chastellux in 1782 as a "Musician, Draftsman, Surveyor, Astronomer, Natural Philosopher, Jurist and Statesman." Jefferson was that and much more. </p><p> He also studied botany, agriculture, forestry, viticulture, and landscape architecture. Monticello's grounds -- which have been likened to an "ornamental working farm" -- were extremely well planned. Jefferson turned the wild hardwood forest on the mountaintop into a park with broad lawns and flowerbeds, and carved out an ornamental forest he called the Grove. He divided the surrounding three hundred acres into seven fields, each of which he planted in a different crop, rotating the crops annually. They were pleasingly and practically separated with rows of peach trees, numbering in the hundreds. </p><p> He selected many more fruit and shade trees, shrubs, and other plants at Main's nursery near Washington and personally laid out the flower beds surrounding the house. He imported seeds from Italy, from the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, and from the top nurseries in Virginia, Philadelphia, Washington, and South Carolina. He planted dozens of varieties of fruit trees, including peaches, apples, cherries, apricots, nectarines, quinces, plums, and pears. He cultivated Seville orange trees, which he brought indoors during the winter, and imported olive trees from Italy and southern France. </p><p> Jefferson built a thousand-foot-long, three-terraced "kitchen" vegetable garden, with twenty-four beds divided into "Fruits, Roots, and Leaves." There he grew some 250 varieties of vegetables, including beans and corn from seeds brought to him by Lewis and Clark, seventeen kinds of peas, white eggplant, and purple broccoli. </p><p> Monticello was "an artistic achievement of the first order," in the words of Jefferson scholar Merrill D. Peterson, but it was a seriously flawed achievement. All was not well when the nation's third president came to live at Monticello full time on March 15, 1809. The debts he had accumulated before becoming president in 1801 still weighed heavily. While Jefferson had managed to pay off many of his pre-Revolutionary debts to British firms out of his not-insignificant $25,000 annual presidential salary, the interest that had accumulated on the remaining debts was crippling. </p><p> Jefferson owed his creditors about $11,000 when he bid farewell to Washington, D.C., and headed home. That amount was not troubling to him, even though there was no presidential pension plan. Jefferson believed that he could easily repay what he owed from the income he would earn from his farming operations at Monticello and his other Virginia properties, which included the nearby farms of Shadwell, Tufton, and Lego in Albemarle County and Poplar Forest in Bedford County. </p><p> There was reason to be optimistic. Jefferson owned a total of some 10,000 acres, about half of it in Albemarle County and the remainder in nearby Bedford County, including his country retreat at the Poplar Forest plantation. He also owned the 157-acre Natural Bridge to the west in Rockbridge County in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. Jefferson had bought that scenic property from King George III for twenty shillings in 1774. The plan was to earn money from travelers who came there to see the spectacular natural rock bridge formation. Jefferson took the first step in that direction in 1803 by building a two-room log cabin on the site. He also owned several building lots, including one in Richmond. He expected to reap further dividends from the two gristmills he owned on the Rivanna River, which he expected to produce more than a thousand dollars in income a year. </p><p> But Jefferson's financial problems worsened after he moved to Monticello. His farming operations rarely did anything but lose money due to periodic droughts, crop failures, and depressed crop prices. The mills were poorly managed and their hoped-for revenues never materialized. Jefferson's debts mounted, augmented by growing sums he owed to Charlottesville-area merchants from whom he bought everything from tea and coffee for his household to salt fish and "Negro cloth" for the more than two hundred slaves he owned. </p><p> He was also burdened financially by his generous hospitality and family responsibilities. Jefferson's wife Martha had died in 1782, but his adult children, his grandchildren, his sisters and their children, and various other relatives and friends spent long periods of time in residence at Monticello, especially after 1815. By all accounts, Jefferson was hospitable to other visitors as well, some who venerated the man, and others who sought him out for favors. They included artists and writers, traveling merchants, would-be biographers, adventurers, and the just plain curious. The list included noted figures such as Daniel Webster, the Marquis de Lafayette, James Madison, and Jefferson's Albemarle County neighbor, James Monroe. The well-heeled came with horses, servants, and family members. Sometimes he found himself hosting as many as fifty guests at a time. </p><p> The domestic manager of the sprawling household during Jefferson's post-presidency retirement was his eldest daughter, Martha Jefferson Randolph, whom Jefferson called "Patsy." Martha had joined the household in 1809, with her children and her husband, Col. Thomas Mann Randolph -- a notoriously inept businessman who was constantly in financial straits. There she continued her role as hostess and female household head that she had begun in Washington. </p><p> Jefferson's financial situation deteriorated further after the War of 1812. His expenses continued to outstrip his income and he was forced to take on additional loans, while continuing to make interest payments. In 1815, his farming operations were particularly hard hit by a severe drought. That spring, Jefferson turned the management of his Albemarle County farms over to Thomas Jefferson Randolph, his eldest and favorite grandson. By all accounts Jeff Randolph was trustworthy and extremely competent in business matters, especially compared to his dissolute father. </p><p> But even with the good management of his grandson, Jefferson's financial woes continued. He experienced some relief in 1815 when Congress, after a spirited debate and by a small majority, agreed to buy his library of 6,487 books for $23,950. Jefferson had offered the books -- the largest personal collection in the country -- to the nation in September soon after he learned that British troops had burned the congressional library in Washington a month earlier. Because of his generous offer to expand the library, Jefferson has been known as the father of the Library of Congress, which had started in 1800 and had consisted of some three thousand volumes before the disastrous fire. A Library of Congress exhibit on Jefferson in 2000 included a re-creation of the library Jefferson sold to the nation in 1815. It filled twenty twelve-foot-high bookcases. </p><p> This large congressional cash infusion did little to stem Jefferson's fiscal woes. He continued to lay out lavish sums to maintain his large household. With his farms and mills providing little or no relief Jefferson was forced to borrow further and his debts mounted. </p><p> In January 1826, five months before his death, the eighty-two-year-old Jefferson came up with a plan that he believed would pay off all his debts: a state lottery. In part, the lottery idea was a reaction to his failed effort to sell off large parcels of land at a time when land prices were severely depressed. When he proposed the idea to the Virginia legislature in Richmond, Jefferson received a lukewarm reception, although several legislators floated a plan to provide him an $80,000 interest-free loan. </p><p> After the Virginia legislature's debate over the lottery made the newspapers, Jefferson's financial plight became known throughout the country. He received many letters of support, including one from James Monroe (1758-1831), the nation's fifth president who owned a large amount of land in the state and was in similar land-rich, cash-poor financial difficulties. </p><p> The publicity over Jefferson's misfortunes resulted in several unsolicited contributions, including a bank note for $7,500 from a group of admirers in New York. </p><p> But Jefferson pinned his hopes on the lottery. He let it be known that if the lottery did not work, he was prepared to sell Monticello and his mills and move to his property in Bedford County. As he put it in a February 17 letter to Madison: "If refused, I must sell everything here, perhaps considerably in Bedford, move thither with my family, where I have not even a log hut to put my head into." </p><p> A lottery bill was passed by the Virginia legislature on February 20, one in which Monticello essentially was the prize. The plan was to sell at least 11,000 lottery tickets at ten dollars each. Under the plan, Jefferson would keep Monticello for the rest of his life, but it would go to the lottery winner after his death. His daughter Martha, the head of the family, was reconciled to losing Monticello after the lottery law was passed. </p><p> When Jefferson died on July 4, 1826, no lottery tickets had yet been sold. </p><p> ... </p><p> At his death Jefferson owed his creditors $107,273.63. The largest amount by far was the $60,110 he owed to his grandson and executor of his estate, Jeff Randolph. Twenty thousand dollars of that amount represented a note Jefferson had co-signed for Jeff's late father-in-law, Wilson Cary Nicholas, and the balance was made up of expenses that Jeff Randolph paid while managing his grandfather's agricultural and other business ventures. </p><p> Jefferson's assets were not listed in his will. However, during the debate over the Jefferson lottery earlier that year, Monticello and its surrounding acres were valued at $71,000. His properties at Shadwell Mills and in Milton were deemed to be worth $41,500. The publicity over the lottery resulted in two other items in the estate's plus column: $10,000 contributions voted to Martha Randolph by the legislatures of South Carolina and Louisiana. </p><p> In his will, Jefferson gave his country retreat, Poplar Forest, to his grandson, Francis Eppes, the son of Jefferson's deceased daughter Maria and her husband (and cousin) John Wayles Eppes.

If not his private shame at how his life there had gone to hell. He was chief of police in Paradise, Mass.This was his town now. Yet there were still some things about the East Coast and the Atlantic he had never gotten used to and wasn't sure he ever would. Nor'easters, for one. He found their brooding, slate-gray clouds and roiling tides a little unnerving. These late-fall or winter storms seemed to blow up out of spite, raking across whole swaths of New England or the Mid� Atlantic, leaving nothing but pain in their wake.<br><br>As was his habit, he drove through the darkened streets of Paradise&nbsp;in his old Ford Explorer before heading horne. He wanted to get a few hours' sleep before going back to work. Maybe a drink, too. The storm wasn't supposed to make landfall until about midnight, but the winds were bending trees back against their will, sleet already pelting his&nbsp;windshield. Jesse shook his head thinking &nbsp;about that. About how storms in the east warned you they were coming. About how they told you when they were coming and then kicked your ass.<br><br> It was different out west. He remembered how, when he was a kid in Tucson, a few inches of unexpected rain would morph into the cascading wall of a flash flood, washing away everything before it. One minute people would be horseback riding or hiking through bone-dry arroyos and the next they'd &nbsp;be swallowed up by waters squeezed between canyon walls and ground sun baked so mercilessly hard it could not soak up a drop of rain. Jesse remembered that he had once gone out with his dad, searching for some missing hikers after one of the floods. How they had come upon the body of a drowned horse. It had been many years since he had thought of that horse, its carcass rotting in the Arizona sun.<br><br> Then in L.A. there were the choking Santa Ana winds that would blow across the mountains, swoop down into the valleys and through the canyons from the Mojave. The Santa Anas brought destruction with them, too, sucking the moisture out of the vegetation, wildfires following in their path. Fires that would consume whole hillsides, one after the other. Sometimes the winds blew so strongly through the &nbsp;canyons that &nbsp;they howled. His ex-partner used to say it was Satan whistling while he worked. At the moment, Jesse felt about as far away from those Santa An as as a man could get, but he thought he could still hear Satan's whistling in &nbsp;the &nbsp;winds that &nbsp;buffeted his SUV.<br><br> There weren't many cars on the road, but a &nbsp;few brave or stupid souls dared the weather. Jesse knew most of the vehicles. Robbie Wil� son, the fire chief, was out in his red Jeep, looking for trouble. Jesse didn't have much patience for men like Wilson, guys who liked being big fish in tiny ponds. Little men with big chips on both shoulders. Men with something to prove, always on the prowl for a chance to&nbsp;prove it. Jesse could never figure out what it was Robbie Wilson had to prove. He also hated that Wilson refused to call him by his first name, always calling him Chief or Chief Stone.<br><br> Alexia Dragoa, one of the few commercial fishermen who still sailed out of Paradise, was coming from the docks in his ancient F-150.That damned pickup was nearly all rust.The thing was like an old married couple who stayed together more out of habit than any� thing else. No doubt Alexia had been securing his boat, the <i>Dragoa Rainha, </i>in anticipation of the storm. Jesse gave the fisherman a wave in passing. Dragoa, a gruff Portuguese SOB, couldn't be bothered to return the gesture. <i>Par for the course) </i>Jesse thought. <i>Par for the course.<br></i><br> Bill Marchand was out in front of his insurance brokerage on Nan� tucket Street, wrestling the wind for control of a storm shutter. Jesse pulled over to lend him a hand. Bill and Jesse were friendly, if not exactly friends. Jesse didn't have friends, not the way other people had friends. But Marchand &nbsp;sponsored the police softball team and was generous with local charities. In all the years Jesse had served as chief, there hadn't been many town selectmen who'd earned his respect. Most selectmen had proven themselves craven and spineless, rarely backing Jesse or the department in tough situations. Bill Marchand was the exception. He was a thoughtful &nbsp;man who had usually based his support not on the direction of the political currents but on the facts before him.<br><br> "Let me get that for you," Jesse said, pinning the shutter to the wall.<br> &nbsp;<br> "Thanks, Jesse. It's &nbsp;gonna be a bad one, this nor'easter. You been through enough of these, you can smell it on the wind."<br><br> "One is &nbsp;enough of these." Jesse used his free hand to lift up the fleece-lined collar of his jacket against the sleet. The wind was gust� ing more intensely. "Ready for the shutter?" Jesse asked.<br><br> "I've got the latch ready."<br> &nbsp;<br> Jesse forced the shutter closed, Marchand helping the last foot or&nbsp;two. When the shutter was in place, the insurance broker latched it closed.<br><br> "I hope the damned thing holds. I've had to replace these shutters&nbsp;twice," Marchand said, raising his voice above the wind.<br> &nbsp;<br> 'Trn sure your insurance will cover it."<br> &nbsp;<br> "You're a funny man, Jesse Stone. Thanks again," Marchand said, offeringJesse his gloved right hand. "It's gonna be a bad one, all right. I'll be busy for weeks after this. We'll have to call adjusters in from all over the States. You watch yourself out there."<br><br> But it was Jesse's job &nbsp;to watch out for everyone else. He waited for Marchand &nbsp;to get into his massive Infiniti SUV and drive offbefore pulling away himself. <i>As </i>Jesse was about to turn for horne, he caught sight of another vehicle he recognized. It was John Millner's beat-up Chevy van. Millner was a career criminal, a petty thief who'd been in and out of commonwealth correctional facilities during Jesse's tenure as chie� Millner was from the Swap-Southwest Area of Paradise� the only rough part of town. But even the Swap was changing. It was turning into a hipper, more ethnically diverse part of Paradise. Mill� ner's family was old-school Swap and John was more a lowlife than a tough guy. A parasite, an opportunist, not a mastermind.<br><br> Jesse followed the white van at a distance up into the bluffs that overlooked the ocean and the rest of town to the south. The Bluffs were where the rich founders of Paradise had built their big fussy houses more than a &nbsp;century and a half ago. Most of those families were gone, their manses knocked down, properties long since sold off. A few, like the Salter place, remained &nbsp;as summer homes. Many had fallen into disrepair.<br><br> Millner's van pulled off the road by a &nbsp;darkened behemoth &nbsp;of a house: the old Rutherford place. It had been vacant for Jesse's entire tenure in Paradise. For years there had been efforts by the town's his� torical society to get it named to the commonwealth's register of&nbsp;historical places, but those avenues had finally been exhausted, and come spring the Rutherford place would be demolished. Jesse had a pretty good idea of what Millner meant to get up to. Giant old houses were lined with miles of copper wiring and other metals that could be sold off to scrap dealers at good prices. The problem for crooked scav� engers like Millner &nbsp;was opportunity. &nbsp;You needed time to &nbsp;break through plaster walls and lath to get to the wiring. And a big storm had opportunity written all over it. Emergency situations stretched the cops thin, especially small-town forces like the Paradise PD.<br><br> Normally, Jesse would &nbsp;have given Millner enough rope to hang himself. He would have let him break into the condemned house before arresting him, but Jesse didn't have time for that now, not with the storm blowing in. When Millner, all six-foot-six of him, got out of his vehicle and went to swing open the van's side door,Jesse shined his Maglite in the thief's face.<br><br> "Who the hell is that?" asked Millner, holding his hand before his eyes to block the light.<br><br> "It's Chief Stone, John. What are you doing here?"<br> &nbsp;<br> Millner hemmed and hawed, thinking of any reasonable lie. "Don't bother," Jesse said. 'Tm &nbsp;not in the mood for your crap.<br><br> Consider yourself lucky I don't want to deal with youtonight. Now get out of here and don't let any of my people catch your ass &nbsp;up here again."<br><br> Millner didn't say a word, just got back into his van and drove away down toward town. Jesse watched the van's taillights until they disappeared. Then &nbsp;he stepped to the edge of the bluff on which the Rutherford house stood. He looked out at the vast blackness of the Atlantic. He listened to the bones of the old house creak in the wind, listened to the wind whistling through the broken windows. He thought he heard the devil at work. He decided he really needed that drink.<br><br> &nbsp;<br>2<br><br><i>He supposed they were all </i>thinking the same thing: This can't be hap� pening. Not again. Not after all these years. But it <i>was </i>happening, only this time they weren't a bunch of kids with too much Southern Comfort and Thai stick in them. That first time, it was some inno� cent fun gone sideways. Severely sideways, plunging them into a para� lyzing hell with slick, jagged walls from which there would be no escape. None. Not ever. That they were here to kill their old friend proved as much.<br><br> They had been given a temporary reprieve, a cruel reprieve, lasting just long enough to fool them into believing they had put real dis� tance between that old evil and the fragile lives they had built in the meantime. Lives that &nbsp;included wives and lovers, children, careers, small successes, and grander failures, but haunted &nbsp;lives just the same. Haunted because distance from evil is &nbsp;a myth of time, because they&nbsp;were never more than one restless night or, worse still, a tainted moment of joy away from it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> The wind rattled the windows and the loading bay door. The&nbsp;plinking of sleet was less urgent now that the snow was falling in sheets and collecting on the corrugated &nbsp;metal roo� Raw, cold air seeped into the maintenance shed like an accusation and made heav� ing clouds of their breath. Small plumes of breath carne from the mouth of the nude man on the floor at their feet. His wrists and ankles were trussed behind him and his sun-streaked brown hair was caked with the drying blood that had leaked from the welt at &nbsp;the base of his skull. His broken lower jaw was unhinged, his mouth a wreck of splintered teeth and bone. After the pipe had been laid into him, the spray ofblood had given the air a coppery tang that the two other men could almost taste. But the blood had settled out of the air like silt out of water. Now the place smelled only ofburnt black motor oil, gasoline fumes, and antifreeze.<br>&nbsp;<br> "What'd you do with his clothes?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "The furnace in the church." "His duffel bag?"<br>&nbsp;<br> "It's a &nbsp;big furnace. Burnt that up, too. Nothing but old smelly clothes and a Bible, anyways."<br>&nbsp;<br> "Okay, drag that canvas over here and wrap it around his head."<br> &nbsp;<br> "You really gonna do this?"<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>"We </i>are."<br> &nbsp;<br> "But that's Zevon, man. He was our friend once."<br> &nbsp;<br> "Friends don't come back to town to fuck up everyone else's lives. If he wanted to stay my friend, he should have stayed lost. You may not have anything to lose, but I do."<br>&nbsp;<br> <b>"But-"</b><br> &nbsp;<br> "But nothing. We talked this through. We all agreed. It's &nbsp;too late&nbsp;now, anyway. He's already more than &nbsp;half dead. Now get the canvas and do what I told you.The storm's blowing in faster than we thought and he's going to be here soon to get rid of the body. C'mon."<br>&nbsp;<br> The unconscious man moaned a little as the coarse, mildewed fab�ric was wrapped around his head. "What's the canvas for, anyways?" "Think about it."<br>&nbsp;<br> "Oh."<br> &nbsp;<br> "Exactly. You got the tarp ready for him? The rope?" "Yeah."<br><br>Outside there was already six inches on the ground and the roads were slick from the layer of sleet that had come before the snow. As he swung around to back up to the bay door, he checked his rearview mirror and saw two quick flashes of lightning and heard two muted claps of thunder. It was done. Zevon was dead. Now the time had come to play his part in keeping the past buried. Yet he understood that this particular episode of thunder and lightning, like their prior sins, was of their own doing and pushed them even further away from heaven than they already were. That &nbsp;the past was unrelenting and that no grave was deep enough to keep it buried forever.<br><br> &nbsp;<br>3<br>&nbsp;<br> <i>Jesse &nbsp;hadn't slept </i>a wink after getting horne. He hadn't tried. He did manage to polish off two Black Labels. That's why he'd headed horne in the first place. Sleep hadn't ever been a part of the plan, not really. It was always about the drinks. Drinkers are great rationalizers, spin� ning tales that only they will hear. Tales only they would believe.Jesse kept a bottle of something in his desk drawer at the station, but he didn't generally prefer drink at work or when the sun was up. Corning horne, having a drink before dinner, then one or two afterward, was sometimes how he got through the day. He knew his bottle of John� nie Walker was horne waiting for him like a faithful wife. He'd had a wife once, just not a faithful one.<br>&nbsp;<br> His ritual entailed pouring the drink-sometimes on the rocks, sometimes in a tall glass with soda-stirring it with his finger, licking the scotch off his finger, raising a toast to his poster of Ozzie Smith, and taking that first sip. Sometimes he savored it. Sometimes, like&nbsp;that night, it was open wide and down the hatch. Any confirmed drinker knows that ritual is &nbsp;as integral to the addiction as the drink� ing itself. Dix was fond of saying that ritual was a secondary reinforce� ment. Jesse laughed at the notion of secondary reinforcement. He liked the drinking well enough all &nbsp;by itself. He enjoyed the ritual on its own merits. He'd gotten some food in him, taken a shower, and watched a half hour of weather reports before heading back to work.<br> &nbsp;<br>Whatever sleep Jesse had managed carne on the cot in his office. He was still on the cot, staring up at the ceiling, when the first dull rays of light filtered in through his window. He noticed the window was no longer being pelted and the howl of the wind had been reduced to a whisper. Morning had brought with it a soft hush. Then there was a knock at &nbsp;his office door.<br>&nbsp;<br> "Corne," he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luther "Suitcase" Simpson carne into the office, a lack of sleep evi� dent on his puffy, still-boyish face and in his bloodshot eyes. He was moving more slowly these days, and not from lack of sleep. It was painful for Jesse to watch. A big man, Suit had been quite the high school football player in his day. But he'd been gut-shot last spring and was only now getting back to work....</p><h2>Sacred Sites: Searching for Book of Mormon Lands</h2><p><p>The primary purpose of this book is to bring to life the historical and geographical elements of the Book of Mormon.

The completion of the history of &#34;&#34;Army Group Center&#34;&#34; is the result of the author&#39;s utilization of all available German and Russian literature, as well as those combat diaries and documents of the committed troop units, that are available in German archives. In addition, the author was assisted in clearing up several questions by the advice of former members of the army group - from commanders to drivers. This three volume set by Werner Haupt began with a volume on Army Group North and will conclude with a volume on Army Group South. The author served in the German Army as a soldier and officer in the northern sector of the Eastern Front during the Second World War. He is also the author of Assault of Moscow 1941 (available from Schiffer Publishing Ltd.).</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Book Arts: Beautiful Bindings for Handmade Books (Can Do Crafts)</h2><p>Handcrafted books of all types. Books can take on a variety of shapes and sizes. A step by step guide for creating these books.</p><p>People have been making books for centuries using a handful of traditional binding techniques. Mary Kaye Seckler&#39;s work combines these time-honored book making traditions with today&#39;s materials and tools to create a look that&#39;s fresh and new.Mary Kaye Seckler&#39;s introduction to books arts came a number of years ago in a series of classes taught by Gayle Burkins and Pam Sussman that she took on a whim. Her passion for books and the creative arts made her an instant connection as she toiled her way through one new stitch after another. Pam and Gayle revealed a whole new artistic world to Mary that fall week-end in a way that was clear, logical and at the same time great fun. Over the years, Mary has learned many of the basic structures you will see in this book from them, and she is grateful for their creativity, patience and humor. Mary urges you to take a class with them if the opportunity arises.

All the power and indignation of the Third Reich now focused on these three young men who dared to distribute the truth about the war to their neighbors. If found guilty, they faced imprisonment, and perhaps even death.</p> <p>Why did they do it? Because the teachings of their parents and the Church taught them to respect individual liberty and to rely on their conscience in choosing between right and wrong. Now their naive confidence was shaken by the torture they'd endured at the hands of the Gestapo. Yet, their brilliant young leader, Helmuth Huebener, whose intelligence and conviction stood out like a beacon of truth in the oppressive courtroom, faced his accusers with confidence. It was his finest moment ... would it be his last?</p></p><p></p><h2>The Awful Rowing Toward God</h2><p>From Wikipedia: Sexton&#39;s eighth collection of poetry is entitled The Awful Rowing Toward God. The title came from her meeting with a Roman Catholic priest who, although unwilling to administer last rites, told her &#34;God is in your typewriter.&#34; This gave the poet the desire and willpower to continue living and writing. The Awful Rowing Toward God and The Death Notebooks are among her final works and both centre on the theme of dying.</p><p></p><h2>Lebek: A City of Northern Europe Through the Ages</h2><p>Describes the development of a fictional city in Northern Europe through the ages.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: ItalianGrade 6-12-- The handsomely detailed two-page black-and-white drawings are an attractive feature of this book, as they were with the authors' previous description of the growth of a European city, Barmi: A Mediterranean City Through the Ages (Houghton, 1990) . This time, readers can trace through text and illustrations, the development of a typical Hanseatic city in Northern Europe. This mythical composite municipality is based on cities such as Lubeck, Hamburg, or Amsterdam, whose wealth was derived from the sea. The first double-page spread shows Lebek as it might have looked in 1,000 b.c. , when it was a timber stockaded village huddling on an island in a North Sea estuary. The modern megalopolis, spreading out in all directions and protected by a complex system of dikes and canals, is a far cry from the humble beginnings. In between, all the different stages of Lebek's evolution are charted by the carefully written text and marvelous illustrations. --David N.

An enthusiastic rower, the young Philadelphia-born Thomas Eakins painted, sketched, and drew an extraordinary series of rowing pictures that were the most ambitious project of his early career. He brought to the theme his personal experiences as an avid amateur rower on his beloved Schuylkill River, and a scientific understanding of the physical effort involved. His 24 rowing works, which include some of the most celebrated and recognized images in the history of American art, are brought together and examined as a group for the first time in this beautiful book. They shed light on the artist's creative process and subsequent achievements as well as on social, cultural, and artistic concerns central to nineteenth-century audiences.<br>Helen A. Cooper, along with essayists Martin A. Berger, Christina Currie, and Amy B. Werbel discuss various aspects of Eakins' rowing series, explaining his affection for the sport, his adoption of the images of popular culture into the realm of fine art, his commitment to novel, "modern" subjects, his preoccupation with perspective and measurement, and his belief that the most profound artistic truths were best expressed through the human figure - particularly the male figure. Just as sculling is dependent upon precision, practice and unwavering dedication, so the paintings were constructed from scrupulous observation of details and intense preparation. In the less than four years in which the rowing pictures were created, Eakins moved subtly from the analytic and descriptive toward the more intuitive and suggestive.</p><p></p><h2>People of the Morning Star: A People of Cahokia Novel (Book One of the Morning Star Series) (North America&#39;s Forgotten Past)</h2><p><p>Award-winning archaeologists and <i>New York Times </i>and <i>USA Today </i>bestselling authors W.

The Whisperer was coming. Right Hand had received word but two days past.</p> <p>Plotting the murder of a living god is a dangerous business. We have no way of knowing how Power will react.</p> <p>The thought sent a flutter of unease through him.</p> <p>According to the latest of the Whisperer&#x2019;s messengers, the time to act had arrived. All Right Hand needed was the &#x201c;token,&#x201d; the weapon with which to strike. If the Whisperer&#x2019;s messenger was correct, it would be delivered today or tomorrow at the latest.</p> <p>Looking down at his mangled right hand, he wondered how the Whisperer had known. Memories of that day, the screams, the pain, returned as fresh as if it were yesterday. Chunkey Boy&#x2019;s brother Walking Smoke and a couple of Four Winds warriors had held him down as Chunkey Boy used Right Hand&#x2019;s own chunkey stone to crush the bones in his hand and fingers.</p> <p>Chunkey Boy&#x2019;s vicious expression remained so clearly imprinted: his lips bared, his eyes slitted with rage. His arm rose and fell, hammering the stone down. Each impact made a wet smacking and snapping as blood spattered and bone crushed.</p> <p>You took so much away from me that day, Chunkey Boy. But you couldn&#x2019;t take my birthright. And now I shall repay you with long smoldering rage.</p> <p>Below his bluff-top vantage, the great city of Cahokia stretched across the floodplain in a confused pattern. Clusters of dwellings concentrated around mound-top temples and palaces, only to give way to interspersed fields before merging with the next batch of closely packed houses around their lofty temples and palaces. At night&#x2014;as if thousands of stars had fallen to earth&#x2014;even the distant Evening Star bluffs on the other side of the river were pinpricked with tiny dots of firelight.</p> <p>Right Hand wore a high chief&#x2019;s white apron decorated with the image of two heavily antlered deer, their front legs raised. The bucks faced each other on either side of a pole decorated with severed human heads.</p> <p>The high chief&#x2019;s broad shoulders narrowed to a slender waist, his body that of a longtime athlete. He wore his gray-streaked hair pulled back in a severe bun and held in place by two flaring copper pins. Though his right hand appeared mutilated, it functioned well enough to clutch a tall staff wrapped with strips of raccoon fur; Raccoon, Spirit messenger of the dead, had special meaning for Right Hand. Several of the characteristic ringed-tails dangled from the top.</p> <p>So much humanity, he thought, wondering if the entire world&#x2019;s population had crowded together here. His tattooed face mimicked a raccoon&#x2019;s black eyes, lines down the cheeks like laid-back whiskers. For the moment it reflected extreme distaste.</p> <p>As he expressed his displeasure, his sister&#x2014;an older woman, and the Deer Clan Matron&#x2014;stepped up beside him. &#x201c;You worry about Power?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t. Since the Beginning Times, the Spirit creatures who dominate the Underworld have always fought in opposition to the Powers of the sky. Morning Star&#x2019;s soul was called down during the daytime, making him not only a creature of the sky, but of light as well.&#x201d;</p> <p>She absently fingered the finely woven blue skirt that clung to her hips. A bright-pink spoonbill-feathered cape graced her shoulders. Her hair had been pulled back in a matron&#x2019;s bun, and polished shell columellas&#x2014;imported from the distant gulf to the south&#x2014;hung from her ears. The skin of her shoulders, back, and chest bore tattoos rendered in an intricate and endless knot of intertwined Tie Snakes&#x2014;a tribute that marked her as a devotee of First Woman.</p> <p>First Woman, the Old-Woman-Who-Never-Dies, the ruler of the Underworld, lived in her cave down below the World Tree&#x2019;s deepest roots. There she dreamed the patterns and Powers of the Underworld. Her realm was portrayed by the color red, indicative of fertility, creativity, war, and chaos. She had dominion over the waters and plants. The Spirit creatures of the Underworld including the Water Panther known as Piasa; the flying snake called Horned Serpent; Snapping Turtle, fish, and frogs answered to First Woman. So, too, did the Tie Snakes who guarded springs, lurked in the depths of the rivers, and invoked the rains; even though doing so infuriated the Thunderbirds, who unleashed lightning bolts in their constant battle with the Powers of the Underworld.</p> <p>Right Hand narrowed his eyes as he studied the distant high mound. In a husky voice he said, &#x201c;It is said in the old stories that at the Creation, First Being, Hunga Ahuito, took the form of a mottled, two-headed eagle. Capable of seeing in all directions at once with its four eyes, and being male and female, it orchestrated all things, ruling even the sun, rainbows, and thunderers. Now Morning Star claims he rules the sky.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But is he a god?&#x201d; Matron Corn Seed paused. &#x201c;Really? Or has the lie been told so often that it now lives on its own?&#x201d; She let her gaze fix on the distant pimple-like prominence; even through the haze of a thousand smoking fires, Morning Star&#x2019;s tall temple atop its great mound couldn&#x2019;t be missed. And that, from where she stood, was still a hard day&#x2019;s walk. Between her bluff-top vantage point and the Morning Star&#x2019;s palace, lived perhaps ten thousand people; their houses, temples, mounds, and fields spread like a poorly woven blanket across the wide floodplain with its curving lakes.</p> <p>The chief extended his good left hand in a grand gesture to include the vast and irregular accumulation of humanity. &#x201c;They believe it. All these simpletons who&#x2019;ve flocked here to revel in the god&#x2019;s presence.&#x201d; He said it bitterly; a smile barely curled his thin lips. &#x201c;And as long as they do, whatever we believe &#x2026; the truth, if you will, is meaningless.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not Power, or him, that I fear,&#x201d; the woman admitted softly. &#x201c;Even if his Spirit really belongs to the hero god and is reincarnated in that young fool&#x2019;s body. It&#x2019;s the Four Winds Clan and that Keeper of theirs who troubles me. Old Blue Heron is like a spider with her bits of web spun everywhere. Make the slightest misstep and an unknown tendril will vibrate just enough to draw her attention.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s merely a woman.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You fear Power. I&#x2019;ve found people are so much more deadly.&#x201d; She gave him a sidelong appraisal. &#x201c;Do not underestimate her. Others have. Hung in a square, people scream the voices right out of their throats when strips of skin are peeled slowly from their bodies.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t intend on hanging from a Four Winds Clan square,&#x201d; he replied, referring to the vertical, open pole frame into which a man&#x2019;s naked body was tied for torture. &#x201c;Myself, I&#x2019;ve taken a lesson from the chickadee.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh? Learned to chirp melodically, or just flit about in panicked terror when the sharp-shinned hawk comes diving?&#x201d;</p> <p>His expression soured at her caustic tone. &#x201c;When a chickadee is hungry, it carefully plucks at a single strand of silk. Spiders can&#x2019;t help themselves. It&#x2019;s in their nature to dash out of their holes toward whatever creature is stuck in their web.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve given the problem some thought?&#x201d;</p> <p>He barely lifted a scarred eyebrow. The action shifted the beaded forelock that hung down over his forehead. &#x201c;When the time comes, the Whisperer will draw the spider into striking distance &#x2026; play her web like a child&#x2019;s string game. It&#x2019;s the Morning Star I&#x2019;m worried about.&#x201d; He hesitated before adding, &#x201c;And whatever agreements he has with the Sky World.&#x201d;</p> <p>She glanced sidelong at him, suspicion in her eyes. &#x201c;For all you know, our mysterious &#x2018;Whisperer&#x2019; might just be the Morning Star himself! I don&#x2019;t trust him, whoever he is. Never have.&#x201d;</p> <p>Right Hand fixed his eyes on the distant palace, now in shadow from one of the fluffy white clouds that drifted across the spring sky. &#x201c;The token could come at any time. And when it does, it will be the signal to strike.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;My chief, no place on earth is more heavily guarded or monitored than Morning Star&#x2019;s high palace.&#x201d; She fingered her prominent nose, eyes on the distant palace where it rose above a thousand peaked roofs. &#x201c;And that&#x2019;s a weakness all its own. I have a candidate in mind.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;One of ours?&#x201d;</p> <p>She smiled grimly. &#x201c;Of course not. My agent has been in touch with a man from the Evening Star House, someone who is vulnerable to persuasion. And, well, he happens to have an incestuous relationship with his daughter. A fact he wouldn&#x2019;t like to have known lest his cousins sneak up and bash his brains out some fine day. He, in turn, has a nephew called Cut String, a proud and vain man who sincerely believed he had earned honors that were not bestowed.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;They can&#x2019;t be traced back to us?&#x201d;</p> <p>She chuckled hoarsely. &#x201c;Do you think I&#x2019;m an idiot? Of course not! The nephew, along with being vain, has a brother in Spotted Wrist&#x2019;s squadron. He&#x2019;s been sent north to try, yet again, to bring Red Wing town and its heretics to heel. If the past is any guide to the future, that young war chief up there, Fire Cat Twelvekiller, he&#x2019;ll rip Spotted Wrist&#x2019;s squadrons to pieces. If the Four Winds Clan catches my assassin, it will look like vengeance and lead them down a false trail &#x2026; right to the Evening Star House.&#x201d; Another pause. &#x201c;Blue Heron and High Dance can tear themselves apart over it. And, who knows? High Dance has never had the subtlety to hide his aspirations. Maybe Blue Heron will find something smoldering there.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You can get this assassin of yours into the palace?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;If the Whisperer&#x2019;s messengers have told us the truth.&#x201d; She nodded absently, eyes half squinted as she stared at the Morning Star&#x2019;s distant palace. &#x201c;Having made a careful study of the palace, I have just the place for Cut String to hide. He&#x2019;s already been given the instructions.&#x201d;</p> <p>The high chief drew a deep breath. &#x201c;The Whisperer is ready. We need but to receive the token, and we are free to strike. Once we kill the Morning Star, the Whisperer will slowly but surely pluck Blue Heron&#x2019;s web in a way that draws her into his reach.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Be careful, brother. If this should go awry&#x2026;&#x201d; She laid a cautious hand on his shoulder.</p> <p>&#x201c;The believers would unleash a blood bath as they sought to snuff out even the faintest whiff of heresy.&#x201d; His smile bent the long scar on his chin. &#x201c;The Whisperer is right. Everything must be traced back to the Four Winds Clan.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;If we do this thing&#x2014;succeed in killing the Morning Star&#x2014;we must act quickly. The Houses of the Four Winds Clan must be incited to turn on one another. If the dirt-farmers and immigrants panic and riot, chaos will be unleashed. Our world will consume itself. What will remain will be soot, ashes, rotting corpses, and ruin.&#x201d;</p> <p>He nodded grimly. &#x201c;Our duty is to ensure it never gets that far. But then, the Four Winds Clan has shown us all how to be gods. And &#x2026; well, what&#x2019;s a little risk compared to those benefits?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Nothing that can&#x2019;t be bought by a little blood and suffering,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;Like the Whisperer, I just want the Four Winds Clan destroyed.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Then, perhaps, we can resurrect the life-soul of Petaga, place it in a young man&#x2019;s body. Reunify the Earth Clans and place the worship of First Woman where it belongs. We can restore the heritage of the great priestess Lichen and the legendary Nightshade.&#x201d;</p> <p>She pointed to a tall man who emerged from between the houses that crowded behind the base of the small, conical burial mound on which they stood. The runner bore a red-fabric-wrapped bundle in his arms. He slowed, chest rising and falling from his long journey. He looked around cautiously, and nodded as the high chief waved. Then he started up the grass-sided mound.</p> <p>Reaching the top, he dropped to one knee, head down, asking in a thick and guttural accent, &#x201c;For which hand?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The right,&#x201d; the high chief replied, glancing down at his maimed hand.</p> <p>The runner, a foreign barbarian, fit-looking and in his mid-twenties, touched his chin in a sign of respect. Oddly, his face bore no tattoos to identify his nation or clan. Reverently, he offered up the red-cloth bundle. No sooner did the high chief lay hold of it than the man rose, spun, and trotted back down the mound. Within a matter of heartbeats, he&#x2019;d disappeared back into the maze of houses.</p> <p>&#x201c;What man gains adulthood without tattoos?&#x201d; Right Hand wondered. &#x201c;Unless he&#x2019;s a slave.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No slave has eyes that arrogant and proud. He was all warrior, that one.&#x201d; She gestured at the bundle. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it?&#x201d;</p> <p>Cradling the wrapping, his raccoon staff in the crook of his right arm, the high chief unwound the red cloth just enough to expose the tip of a long stone blade. Sunlight glistened in parallel rows of rippling flake scars. A master had carefully chipped the slim blade from a beautiful translucent brown chert; the edge sharp enough to split a hair.</p> <p>&#x201c;The Whisperer is as good as his word. Now all we have to do is get this to your assassin, Matron.&#x201d; He paused watching the light play on the deadly blade. &#x201c;And hope it drinks deeply of the Morning Star&#x2019;s blood.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by W.

Mining there, as everywhere, was not an easy life, but regardless of the risk, there was something about being underground, the lure of hitting a deep vein of silver. The promise of good money and the intense bonds of friendship brought men back year after year. Mining is about being a man and a fighter in a job where tomorrow always brings the hope of a big score. <br><br>On May 2, 1972, 174 miners entered Sunshine Mine on their daily quest for silver. Aboveground, safety engineer Bob Launhardt sat in his office, filing his usual mountain of federal and state paperwork. From his office window he could see the air shafts that fed fresh air into the mine, more than a mile below the surface. The air shafts usually emitted only tiny coughs of exhaust; unlike dangerously combustible coal mines, Sunshine was a fireproof hardrock mine, nothing but cold, dripping wet stone. There were many safety concerns at Sunshine, but fire wasn&#x2019;t one of them. The men and the company swore the mine was unburnable, so when thick black smoke began pouring from one of the air shafts, Launhardt was as amazed as he was alarmed. <br><br>When the alarm sounded, less than half of the dayshift was able to return to the surface. The others were trapped underground, too deep in the mine to escape. Scores of miners died almost immediately, frozen in place as they drilled, ate lunch, napped, or chatted. No one knew what was burning or where the smoke had come from. But in one of the deepest corners of the mine, Ron Flory and Tom Wilkinson were left alone and in total darkness, surviving off a trickle of fresh air from a borehole. <br><br>The miners&#x2019; families waited and prayed, while Launhardt, reeling from the shock of losing so many men on his watch, refused to close up the mine or give up the search until he could be sure that no one was left underground.<br><br>In <i>The Deep Dark</i>, Gregg Olsen looks beyond the intensely suspenseful story of the fire and rescue to the wounded heart of Kellogg, a quintessential company town that has never recovered from its loss. A vivid and haunting chapter in the history of working-class America, this is one of the great rescue stories of the twentieth century.</p><p>Gregg Olsen is the author of seven nonfiction books, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Abandoned Prayers</i>. A journalist and investigative author for more than two decades, Olsen has received numerous awards and much critical acclaim for his writing. The Seattle native now lives in rural Washington state with his wife, twin daughters, cat, and six chickens.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>Sunrise<br>Tuesday, May 2<br>Coeur d&#x2019;Alene Mining District<br><br>Morning rush hour in the Idaho panhandle was a stream of primer-splattered bombers and gleaming pickups on big tires that pushed the cab halfway to the sky. All were driven by miners hurrying to get underground. Many rode together so their wives and girlfriends could use their cars to run errands during the day. Some smoked and nursed hangovers with coffee as they planned their day underground: how much they&#x2019;d have to blast, and how much muck they&#x2019;d haul out. Some of the best of them took the Big Creek exit between Kellogg and Wallace. Around a sharp curve on the edge of the Bitterroot Mountains, buildings congregated among the steep folds of stony terrain bisected by the rushing waters of Big Creek. A giant green structure clad in sheet metal was planted as though a twister had dropped it in on the edge of the parking lot. A few other buildings flanked the green monster, though none was nearly as commanding. On the other side of the creek was a backbonelike array of metal and wood-frame buildings that included a mill, dry house, machine shop, warehouse, hoist house, assay office, electric shop, drill shop, and compressor shop. The most visually pleasing edifice was the personnel office, a two-story, variegated redbrick structure with a peaked roof and a walk-up pay window. A sign proclaimed that the property belonged to the Sunshine Mining Company, but the biggest billboard faced the mine yard. In demi-bold letters it read, "Today is the first day of the rest of your life&#x2013;live it safely."<br><br>Sunshine has long been legendary, even sacred, among miners. Maine brothers Dennis and True Blake discovered what would become Sunshine in 1884 when a soft glint beckoned from an outcropping on the eastern ridge of Big Creek Canyon. Assaying indicated tetrahedrite, a superior silver ore, and not galena or lead, which was scavenged by other area mines. For a couple of decades the former farm boys worked underground by candlelight while mules hauled out ore and dragged it down Big Creek Canyon on skids. They quietly made a small fortune, calling their discovery the Yankee Lode. Later, in 1921, when they sold their stake to Yakima, Washington, interests, it was renamed Sunshine Mining Company.<br><br>It was another decade before Sunshine came into its own, when, at a depth of 1,700 feet, an ore vein of astounding breadth&#x2014;23 feet&#x2014;was discovered. In time, the mine would give up more silver than any other mine in the world, a distinction it would hold for decades. In addition to lead and copper, it was also a leading producer of antimony, a metallic by-product primarily used to harden lead. Sunshine&#x2019;s triumph was the result of the development effort led by the go-for-broke, risk-taking owners from Washington State. Most silver mines followed veins from outcroppings that eventually became stringers and petered out. Outside of the Coeur d&#x2019;Alene Mining District, it was a rare operation that extracted ore at depths greater than 1,000 feet. Not only did Sunshine have viable ore below 1,200 feet, but in the decades that followed, crosscuts chased high-grade ore bodies all the way to the 5600 level. Sunshine by itself was far richer and produced more silver than all the mines on the fabled Comstock Lode combined.<br><br>Idaho mines shared more than just their luminous underground Dagwood sandwich of lead, silver, and zinc. Labor strikes, chronic absenteeism, and pumped-up wanderlust made the workforces somewhat fluid. Tough and experienced miners moved freely among Galena, Lucky Friday, Star, Silver Summit, Bunker Hill, and Sunshine. But even as itchy-footed as miners could be, every man had his home mine. It was the mine to which he knew he could always return.<br><br>Around the time Bob Launhardt, forty-one, backed his &#x2019;68 maroon Chrysler Newport out of his Pinehurst driveway, the sun had risen, leaving the sky awash in luminous Maxfield Parrish hues. The men of Sunshine&#x2019;s graveyard shift were leaving the mine. As safety engineer, Launhardt made it a practice to get underground as early as possible&#x2014;before the day shift rode down to their working levels. He liked to get a head start on the day. Tall and lanky, Launhardt had dark, wavy hair that he combed back with a slight swoop. Black-framed glasses made him look like a schoolteacher, or maybe a middle-aged Buddy Holly. After a five-year absence, Launhardt returned to the district in February 1972, bailing out of another job going nowhere, wanting to reconnect with a part of his life where he felt worthwhile. He was quiet and thoughtful, the kind of man who got lost in a crowd, yet Launhardt believed he stood out because of his fierce dedication to the safety of the men of Sunshine. No one questioned his passion for his work. It was apparent in every move he made. Many, however, found it difficult to connect with him on a personal level. Guys he&#x2019;d known for years never even got his name right. They called him Bob Longhart. Part of the distance was the result of his personality, but it was also his status as a salaried man. Miners saw Launhardt, other managers, and office workers as outsiders. The fact that Sunshine&#x2019;s owners were now New Yorkers who hadn&#x2019;t blasted a round in their lives didn&#x2019;t help. Yet managers and bean counters were necessary. Silver mining was, after all, a business&#x2013;and a dangerous one, at that. As safety engineer, Launhardt was there to make certain that each day every man who went into the mine came out alive. That involved working with national and state labor agencies and the U.S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) to ensure that safety regulations were in place. It meant seeing that equipment was up to date and miners were properly trained in evacuation and rescue techniques. Guarding miners&#x2019; lives was a crucial job because so much could go wrong. Government statisticians and mining district undertakers frequently acknowledged mining as the most perilous job on or under the earth. Some assumed the safety engineer&#x2019;s position existed solely to meet government regulations, mitigate the risk of union complaints, and dodge civil lawsuits. Some mine managers considered it little more than a necessary nuisance. The workers themselves understood that there were ways to avoid injury, but they dismissed many of those measures. Many considered risk and danger essential to the job&#x2019;s mystique. Launhardt, a bespectacled Goody-Two-shoes among his peers, believed that if he could get men to think before they blast, to wear safety glasses, to cool it on the horseplay, just maybe he could save a life. His biggest challenge in 1972 was the same as always: How do you convince men that accidents are unacceptable and unnecessary? For Launhardt, who had once studied to be a Lutheran minister, promoting safety became as important as preaching the word of God.<br><br>There were many reasons for his vigilance, and all were damned good ones. Sometimes men fell down shafts so deep that nothing remained but bloody clothes and serrated splinters of bone. Rockbursts or airblasts, however, were the most feared of district hazards. Those occurred when the stone ceiling exploded under pressure and sent slabs of rock the size of camping trailers down to pulverize men into biological splat. Other times, it was the floor that gave way. The lucky ones were buried alive until someone could move two tons of rock to free them. Although Sunshine had its share, the district&#x2019;s Galena Mine was considered one of the worst, if not the worst, for rockbursts. Anyone who&#x2019;d worked there longer than a month experienced the sudden and frightening reaction of rock giving way to pressure. Old hands knew that as long as the rock was talking&#x2014;making characteristic popping and grinding noises&#x2014;they&#x2019;d be all right. When it got quiet, that was the time to think about moving to a different location or taking lunch early. Whenever it was quiet underground, look out.<br><br>In the battle being waged by men with jackleg drills against the fractured and folded metamorphic world of the underground, men frequently lost. Every man knew there was no guarantee he&#x2019;d ever see daylight again.<br><br>Launhardt knew some accidents had more to do with human error&#x2014;little mistakes that miners made doing things they did right every other day. Veteran miner Stanley Crawford&#x2019;s accident was a case in point. Crawford had been setting charges on some blocking in a shaft, as he&#x2019;d done countless times. He set four fuses, but only three blasts rumbled through the mine. Crawford was confident that two had ignited simultaneously, thus obscuring the distinct sound of a fourth explosion.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna go look,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>His partner didn&#x2019;t like the idea. &#x201c;Stay here and have a cigarette. We can check it after dinner.&#x201d;<br><br>But Crawford was impatient and insistent. As he bent closer to take a look in the smoky air, the charge ignited. It was the last thing he ever saw. His eyes were blasted from their sockets like a pair of soft-boiled eggs.<br><br>Sunshine&#x2019;s safety engineer knew the inherent reasons for Crawford&#x2019;s mistake. The greater the danger, the more reckless men became. It was a mix of laziness, tempting fate for the buzz of adrenaline, and just plain ignoring the obvious. More men were hurt and even more died because someone decided to push something to a new limit. Miners sometimes took the extra step toward trouble. Trouble could be a rush.<br><br>Some health hazards were slower in catching up with the miners. Airborne silica turned lungs into wheezing dust bags. Corneas were trashed by gritty dust belching through the working areas, forced along by the man-made cyclone of ventilation fans. The omnipresent dust that bloomed inside the working areas after blasting consisted of near-microscopic particles of lead, tetrahedrite, and razorlike pieces of silica from the quartz that frequently hosted the veins being mined. After each round was blasted, the air thickened...</p><h2>Franklin&#39;s Birthday Party</h2><p>In the heat of excitement, Franklin invites all of his friends to his birthday party at Tamarack Play Park, but he soon learns from his parents that they can only afford to pay for two of his friends, not all of them, and Franklin wonders what to do.

In this wide-ranging expose, crime reporter Randazzo demonstrates that, among professionals driven to incredible levels of steroid, drug and alcohol abuse, Benoit was not unique. Benoit spent years in Canada and Japan enduring training that bordered on the medieval, eagerly employing steroids to achieve the industry's standard physique. As his star rose, so did the injuries and the chemicals; Benoit's signature move, a flying headbutt, was responsible for countless concussions. Culminating in a 2001 spinal injury that left him at risk of permanent paralysis, Benoit, like many other wrestlers, treated himself with copious doses of painkillers before returning to work for more punishment.

Sankara Saranam shows why organized religion has long been the cause of humanity&#x2019;s worst wars and most acute suffering&#x2014;then guides us beyond our divisive history into more expansive perceptions capable of creating a unified, peaceful future. Through a series of penetrating inquiries and practices, readers are invited to examine their beliefs, explore the nature of the divine, and develop personal knowledge of God.</p><p>From the Preface <p>Religion never satisfied me, and often infuriated me. Though I was raised to be a Jew, I thought of myself first and foremost as a human being and never viewed myself as wiser, luckier, or happier because my parents were Jewish or I adhered to the accepted truths of their religious tradition. To my mind, I would be progressing spiritually only by understanding what was universally right and natural in life and how to live accordingly. </p><p>After years of attending Hebrew school, I rebelled against the dogma I was taught there. In college I focused on subjects requiring the use of logic that appealed to my scientific mind. However, I eventually found that while the material sciences could answer some questions concerning how the world worked, they could not prescribe an ethical way to live. </p><p>Searching further, I investigated mystical techniques. I began practicing sophisticated methods of sense introversion. I implemented an <i>inner</i> science to address the concerns unresolved by my studies. Over the next decade, I came to realize God as a spiritually expansive substance extending throughout the cosmos&#x2014;a much more universal presence than that proposed by many organized religions. God, I found, was everything, and being godlike meant identifying with, and not merely tolerating, more and more people. Understanding that the idea of God signified absolute unity, I concluded that anyone advocating unquestioning loyalty to a restrictive group such as a faith, ethnicity, or nation was in fact promoting the fall of humanity by advancing its division....</p>Disillusioned with organized religion, some people escape into New Age movements and others retreat from their spiritual moorings altogether. A more satisfying and transformative option is to embark on a quest to discover God on your own. Using time-tested tools of spiritual investigation, it becomes possible to examine your present beliefs, explore the nature of God and sense of self, and ultimately expand your identity. <i>God Without Religion</i> introduces this age-old approach to spiritual inquiry for modern-day readers. Step by step, it offers a bridge between organized religion and mystical spirituality for anyone questioning traditional dogma or its legacy of divisiveness. It also assists in overcoming limitations and notions of exclusivity promoted by New Age movements. Included are seventeen universal techniques for developing personal knowledge of God and broadening your view of yourself, others, and all of life. <p>"The genuine seeker must utilize both the critical mind and the generous heart.

He wasn&#x2019;t allowed to sleep in his mother&#x2019;s house anymore, being fourteen years old. No self-respecting woman of Basilica would put her daughter in Rasa&#x2019;s household if a fourteen-year-old boy were in residence--especially since Nafai had started a growth spurt at the age of twelve that showed no signs of stopping even though he was already near two meters in height.<br>Only yesterday he had overheard his mother talking with her friend Dhelembuvex. &#x201c;People are beginning to speculate on when you&#x2019;re going to find an auntie for him,&#x201c; said Dhel.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s still just a boy,&#x201c; said Mother.<br>Dhel hooted with laughter. &#x201c;Rasa, my dear, are you so afraid of growing old that you can&#x2019;t admit your little baby is a man?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not fear of age,&#x201c; said Mother. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s time enough for aunties and mates and all that business when he starts thinking about it himself.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, he&#x2019;s <em>thinking</em>about it already,&#x201c; said Dhel. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s just not talking to <em>you</em>about it.&#x201d;<br>It was true enough; it had made Nafai blush when he heard her say it, and it made him blush again when he remembered it. How did Dhel know, just to look at him for a moment that day, that his thoughts were so often on &#x201c;that business&#x201d;? But no, Dhel didn&#x2019;t know it because of anything she had seen in Nafai. She knew it because she knew men. I&#x2019;m just going through an age, thought Nafai. All boys start thinking these thoughts at about this age. Anyone can point at a male who&#x2019;s near two meters in height but still beardless and say, &#x201c;That boy is thinking about sex right now,&#x201c; and most of the time they&#x2019;ll be right.<br>But I&#x2019;m <em>not</em>like all the others, thought Nafai. I hear Mebbekew and his friends talking, and it makes me sick. I don&#x2019;t like thinking of women that crudely, sizing them up like mares to see what they&#x2019;re likely to be useful for. A pack animal or can I ride her? Is she a walker or can we gallop? Do I keep her in the stable or bring her out to show my friends?<br>That wasn&#x2019;t the way Nafai thought about women at all. Maybe because he was still in school, still talking to women every day about intellectual subjects. I&#x2019;m not in love with Eiadh because she&#x2019;s the most beautiful young woman in Basilica and therefore quite probably in the entire world. I&#x2019;m in love with her because we can talk together, because of the way she thinks, the sound of her voice, the way she cocks her head to listen to an idea she doesn&#x2019;t agree with, the way she rests her hand on mine when she&#x2019;s trying to persuade me.<br>Nafai suddenly realized that the sky was starting to grow light outside his window, and here he was lying in bed dreaming of Eiadh, when if he had any brains at all he&#x2019;d get up and get into the city and <em>see</em>her in person.<br>No sooner thought of than done. He sat up, knelt beside his mat, slapped his bare thighs and chest and offered the pain to the Oversoul, then rolled up his bed and put it in his box in the corner. I don&#x2019;t really need a bed, thought Nafai. If I were a real man I could sleep on the floor and not mind it. That&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;ll become as hard and lean as Father. As Elemak. I won&#x2019;t use the bed tonight.<br>He walked out into the courtyard to the water tank. He dipped his hands into the small sink, moistened the soap, and rubbed it all over. The air was cool and the water was cooler, but he pretended not to notice until he was lathered up. He knew that this chill was nothing compared to what would happen in a moment. He stood under the shower and reached up for the cord--and then hesitated, bracing himself for the misery to come.<br>&#x201c;Oh, just pull it,&#x201c; said Issib.<br>Nafai looked over toward Issib&#x2019;s room. He was floating in the air just in front of the doorway. &#x201c;Easy for <em>you</em>to say,&#x201c; Nafai answered him.<br>Issib, being a cripple, couldn&#x2019;t use the shower; his floats weren&#x2019;t supposed to get wet. So one of the servants took his floats off and bathed him every night. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re such a baby about cold water,&#x201c; said Issib.<br>&#x201c;Remind me to put ice down your neck at supper.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;As long as you woke me up with all your shivering and chattering out here--&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t make a sound,&#x201c; said Nafai.<br>&#x201c;I decided to go with you into the city today.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Fine, fine. Fine as wine,&#x201c; said Nafai.<br>&#x201c;Are you planning to let the soap dry? It gives your skin a charming sort of whiteness, but after a few hours it might begin to itch.&#x201d;<br>Nafai pulled the cord.<br>Immediately ice-cold water cascaded out of the tank over his head. He gasped--it always hit with a shock--and then bent and turned and twisted and splashed water into every nook and crevice of his body to rinse the soap off. He had only thirty seconds to get clean before the shower stopped, and if he didn&#x2019;t finish in that time he either had to live with the unrinsed soap for the rest of the day--and it <em>did</em>itch, like a thousand fleabites--or wait a couple of minutes, freezing his butt off, for the little shower tank to refill from the big water tank. Neither consequence was any fun, so he had long since learned the routine so well that he was always clean before the water stopped.<br>&#x201c;I love watching that little dance you do,&#x201c; said Issib.<br>&#x201c;Dance?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Bend to the left, rinse the armpit, bend the other way, rinse the left armpit, bend over and spread your cheeks to rinse your butt, bend over backward--&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All right, I get it,&#x201c; said Nafai.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious, I think it&#x2019;s a wonderful little routine. You ought to show it to the manager of the Open Theatre. Or even the Orchestra. You could be a star.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A fourteen-year-old dancing naked under a stream of water,&#x201c; said Nafai. &#x201c;I think they&#x2019;d show that in a different kind of theatre.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But still in Dolltown! You&#x2019;d still be a hit in Dolltown!&#x201d;<br>By now Nafai had toweled himself dry--except his hair, which was still freezing cold. He wanted to run for his room the way he used to do when he was little, jabbering nonsense words--&#x201d;ooga-booga looga-booga&#x201d; had been a favorite--while he pulled on his clothes and rubbed himself to get warm. But he was a man now, and it was only autumn, not winter yet, so he forced himself to walk casually toward his room. Which is why he was still in the courtyard, stark naked and cold as ice, when Elemak strode through the gate.<br>&#x201c;A hundred and twenty-eight days,&#x201c; he bellowed.<br>&#x201c;Elemak!&#x201d; cried Issib. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re back!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No thanks to the hill robbers,&#x201c; said Elemak. He walked straight to the shower, pulling off his clothes as he went. &#x201c;They hit us only two days ago, way too close to Basilica. I think we killed one this time.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you know whether you did or not?&#x201d; asked Nafai.<br>&#x201c;I used the pulse, of course.&#x201d;<br>Of course? thought Nafai. To use a hunting weapon against a <em>person</em>?<br>&#x201c;I saw him drop, but I wasn&#x2019;t about to go back and check, so maybe he just tripped and fell down at the exact moment that I fired.&#x201d;<br>Elemak pulled the shower cord <em>before</em>he soaped. The moment the water hit him he yowled, and then did his own little splash dance, shaking his head and flipping water all over the courtyard while jabbering &#x201c;ooga-booga looga-booga&#x201d; just like a little kid.<br>It was all right for Elemak to act that way. He was twenty-four now, he had just got his caravan safely back from purchasing exotic plants in the jungle city of Tishchetno, the first time anyone from Basilica had gone <em>there</em>in years, and he might actually have killed a robber on the way. No one could think of Elemak as anything but a man. Nafai knew the rules: When a man acts like a child, he&#x2019;s boyish, and everyone&#x2019;s delighted; when a boy acts the same way, he&#x2019;s childish, and everyone tells him to be a man.<br>Elemak was soaping up now. Nafai--freezing still, even with his arms folded across his chest--was about to go into his room and snag his clothes, when Elemak started talking again.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve grown since I left, Nyef.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been doing that lately.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Looks good on you. Muscling up pretty well. You take after the old man in all the right ways. Got your mother&#x2019;s face, though.&#x201d;<br>Nafai liked the tone of approval in Elemak&#x2019;s voice, but it was also vaguely demeaning to stand there naked as a jaybird while his brother sized him up.<br>Issib, of course, only made it worse. &#x201c;Got Father&#x2019;s most important feature, fortunately,&#x201c; he said.<br>&#x201c;Well, we <em>all</em>got that,&#x201c; said Elemak. &#x201c;All of the old man&#x2019;s babies have been boys--or at least all his babies that we <em>know</em>about.&#x201d; He laughed.<br>Nafai hated it when Elemak talked about Father that way. Everyone knew that Father was a chaste man who only had sex with his lawful mate. And for the past fifteen years that mate had been Rasa, Nafai&#x2019;s and Issib&#x2019;s mother, the contract renewed every year. He was so faithful that women had given up coming to visit and hint around about availability when his contract lapsed. Of course, Mother was just as faithful and there were still plenty of men plying <em>her</em>with gifts and innuendoes--but that&#x2019;s how some men were, they found faithfulness even more enticing than wantonness, as if Rasa were staying so faithful to Wetchik only to goad them on in their pursuit of her. Also, mating with Rasa meant shari...</p></p><h2>Dark Side of the Moon: Wernher von Braun, the Third Reich, and the Space Race</h2><p><b>A stunning investigation of the roots of the first moon landing forty years ago.</b> This illuminating story of the dawn of the space age reaches back to the reactionary modernism of the Third Reich, using the life of "rocket scientist" Wernher von Braun as its narrative path through the crumbling of Weimar Germany and the rise of the Nazi regime. Von Braun, a blinkered opportunist who could apply only tunnel vision to his meteoric career, stands as an archetype of myriad twentieth century technologists who thrived under regimes of military secrecy and unlimited money. His seamless transformation from developer of the deadly V-2 ballistic missile for Hitler to an American celebrity as the supposed genius behind the golden years of the U.S. space program in the 1950s and 1960s raises haunting questions about the culture of the Cold War, the shared values of technology in totalitarian and democratic societies, and the imperatives of material progress.<br><br>A New York Times Book Review "Editor's Choice"<br><br> 12 illustrations.</p><p>An interview with the author on Canadian Broadcasting radio may be downloaded at:<br>cbc.ca/quirks/episode/2009/12/19/holiday-book-show-polar-obsession-poseidons-steed-dark-side-of-the-moon/"Von Braun's meteoric career as a political chameleon and rocket man is brilliantly peeled apart with a lucidity that allows the reader to understand the complex intricacies of von Braun's mentality as well as the scientific issues involved.&nbsp; It's a splendid piece of both science writing and history."<br>Paul Lawrence Rose</p><h2>Helmut Volter: Cloud Studies</h2><p>Clouds are fleeting entities &#x2013; studying them so as to correctly classify, name and read their forms was considered in the 19th and early 20th centuries an important step in coming to understand the secrets of the atmosphere.

Read his review of <i>Think of a Number</i> below: </b></p> <p> </p> <p>John Verdon has done something remarkable in his debut thriller, <i>Think of a Number</i>. He has successfully juggled every storytelling ball, character, atmosphere, prose, pace and plot, with the skill and assuredness of a veteran novelist at the top of his game. The writing is haunting and quotable, the twists expertly placed and infinitely plausible, the conjured locations vivid and memorable, the characters full of depth and promise. You can read the book as a game of cat and mouse, a ride of chilling suspense, or a literary repast, since it provides all in abundance. In the novel the set-up provides an intriguing dilemma. A man gets a letter that scares him to death by challenging him to think of a number. That catalyst soon speeds the reader and Verdon&#x2019;s hero, Dave Gurney, a legendary and now retired NYPD detective, headlong into a mystery of the first order. I&#x2019;m pretty adept at figuring out these types of stories and while I hit on a few twists before Verdon probably wanted me to, the major ones were stunning surprises. I read the last two-hundred pages in one sitting. I did this for two compelling reasons. First, to find out what the hell was going on. And second, just to enjoy the wonderful writing. Some novelists promise plot and pace and deliver it with lightweight characters and silly dialogue. Others get the characters spot-on but the story is mediocre and predictable. Verdon nails it all in his first novel. The villain is appealingly terrifying, smart and cunning while operating mostly in absentia, and that is incredibly difficult to accomplish. The answer behind the &#x201c;think of a number&#x201d; plot, most certainly a disaster in lesser hands, proves clever, winning and eminently believable. Verdon&#x2019;s protagonist Dave Gurney is one for the ages, and readers everywhere will surely clamor to see this man again. <i>Think of a Number</i> gets full marks from me. And I think it will from you, too.

Yet few understand what the crisis really is, why it happened, or how the Church must respond to it. As no other commentator or critic has done, George Weigel situates the current crisis of sexual abuse and episcopal malfeasance in the context of recent Catholic history. With honesty and critical rigor, he reveals the Church&#39;s failure to embrace the true spiritual promise of Vatican II, a failure that has resulted in the gradual but steady surrender to liberal culture that he dubs &#34;Catholic Lite.&#34; Drawing upon his unparalleled knowledge of how the Church works, both in America and in Rome, Weigel exposes the patterns of dissent and self-deception that became entrenched in seminaries, among priests, and ultimately among the bishops who failed their flock by thinking like managers instead of apostles. But, Weigel reminds us, in the Biblical world a &#34;crisis&#34; is a time of great opportunity, an invitation to deeper faith. Every great crisis of the Church&#39;s past, from the Dark Ages to the Reformation, has resulted in a period of reform that returned the Church-and its priesthood-to its roots. Weigel sets forth an agenda for genuine reform that challenges seminarians, priests, bishops, and the laity to lead more integrally Catholic lives. As he argues so persuasively, the answer to the present crisis will not be found in &#34;Catholic Lite&#34; but in classic Catholicism: a Catholicism that has reclaimed the wisdom of the past in order to face the corruptions of the present and create a strong future.</p><p><b>George Weigel</b>, a Roman Catholic theologian and one of America's leading commentators on religion and public life, is the author of the acclaimed <i>The Courage to Be Catholic</i> , the international bestseller, <i>Witness to Hope: The Biography of John Paul II</i> , and numerous other books that include <i>The Truth of Catholicism</i> and <i>The Final Revolution</i> . Now a Senior Fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, D.C., where he holds the John M. Olin Chair in Religion and American Democracy, Weigel writes a weekly column, "The Catholic Difference," that is syndicated to more than forty newspapers around the United States. He is an NBC consultant on the Vatican and appears regularly on network and cable television programs as well as national and local radio. Weigel lives with his wife and their three children in North Bethesda, Maryland.The Catholic Church in the United States is reeling from the scandal associated with the sexual abuse of minors by priests. Weigel, who has written a magisterial biography of Pope John Paul II (Witness to Hope), examines the predicament in this extended essay. He proposes that the church is in crisis, as understood in its radical sense: it is a time of judgment, also an opportunity for reflection and reform. Weigel dismisses the allegations that the sexual misbehavior of priests is the result of celibacy, a repressive sexual ethic, or an authoritarian church structure. His thesis is that the crisis is, at heart, one of fidelity. Priests have abandoned their identity as living icons of Christ, bishops have functioned more as managers than as shepherds, and the larger Catholic community has drifted from its Christ-given roots to a kind of "Catholic Lite." Weigel argues that the remedy to the present situation is to return to a classic Catholicism, deepening the reforms begun by Vatican Council II and urged by John Paul II throughout his pontificate. His argument that priests are "ontologically changed" by ordination needs significant nuance, and over three-quarters of the U.S. bishops about whom this papal loyalist complains have been appointed by the present pope. Weigel's contention may work within the confines of his perspective. All Catholics, particularly those he calls members of the "Catholic Lite," may not agree with his viewpoint or his assessment.

More than just a cookbook, <i>Livin' Low Carb</i> is a practical guide to a sustainable low-carb lifestyle.</p><p><i>George Stella's Livin' Low Carb</i> has little in common with diet books: In fact, it's got more in common with a cookbook you might have bought for yourself when you first moved out on your own. The style is casual and approachable, with no tense lists of diet-related details or overly-complex recipes, and cooking techniques require little more than a working stove and a frying pan. <p> George Stella (along with pastry chef-wife Rachel) have developed a wide range of recipes designed to compliment Atkins and other low-carb diet regimens. Rather than relying on packaged convenience foods that meet these dietary standards, they focus on home-cooked meals that satisfy the demands of low carb life without tasting like they were baked up in a factory. Flavors include Chinese (Szechuan stir-fry), Italian-American (clams casino), Southern (fried chicken), and American sweets (chocolate chip muffins and no-bake Key lime cheesecake). Snacks, salads, entrees, and desserts all see equal amounts of attention. </p><p> There's a heavy reliance on the sugar substitute Splenda, but in general this is real food for daily life. The condiment chapter contains homemade versions of ketchup, mustard sauce, barbecue sauce and even Thousand Island dressing, and makes a simple place to get started even if the only kitchen appliance you're comfortable with is a can opener. Each recipe clearly notes "special equipment" (like 8-inch square pans) as well as the yield, net carbs per serving, and separate times needed for prepping and cooking. </p><p> Because of the sugar substitute and number of recipes that alter classics in ways that compromise traditional textures in favor of lowering carbs (such as noodle-free lasagna), the book is most likely to be used by dieters, rather than all home cooks. Still, if you're looking for easy ways to tinker with your food intake that doesn't involve packaged mixes from the diet industry, Stella offers plenty of tasty options. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><b>George Stella,</b> a professional chef for more than twenty years, is the author of George Stella's <i>Livin' Low Carb</i> and the host of the Food Network's <i>Low Carb and Lovin' It.</i> He lives with his wife and sons, Anthony and Christian, in Norwalk, Connecticut.</p><h2>Highland Master (The Murrays)</h2><p><i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Hannah Howell returns to the unforgettable Murray family with this all-new tale of perilous trust igniting irresistible desire. . .<br><br>Lady Triona McKee's life is under desperate siege.

Looking out from behind the bars was the blue-and-gold macaw that my friend Samantha had given me without cost because of my track record in redeeming problematic or rescue animals. "Peg Leg," as she had been named by her previous owner, was a rescue bird, much larger than I remembered and, according to her previous veterinarian, vicious. I had seen her only once at Samantha's wild bird rescue ranch, but here in our ten-by-twelve-foot space she seemed far more imposing. She was nearly two feet tall, and her most impressive feature was certainly her feathers, brilliant blues and golds that extended to the tip of each two-foot wing. Then there were the eyes, soft black inside a white mask streaked with black lines like those of a Mayan shaman or African warrior. The effect was dramatic and not just a little intimidating, although not as intimidating as the beak, also black, which from nose to crown measured nearly four inches. She had only one foot. Her left foot had been cut off by her captors while they tried to release her from the parrot snare that had ended her life as a free bird in the Amazon basin. As I moved closer to the cage, her powerful gaze asked only one question: Predator or prey?<br><br>The bird I had originally wanted was an African grey, far smaller than a macaw and known for its high verbal fluency and mild temperament. I had first seen one at a "Parrot Weekend Experience" sponsored by Samantha and a group of breeders, rescuers, owners, and veterinarians. For three days I listened to lectures, heard amazing stories of bird antics and adventures, while interacting with both domestically raised and wild-caught parrots-from cherry-headed conures to cockatoos to African greys to the ultimate macaw, the largest of all the parrots and the most temperamental. Given the size of the macaw's beak and the bird's propensity for biting, I was hesitant to hold one or have it perch on my arm. Much more my style was the grey I fancied, who unfortunately already belonged to someone else. This weekend had been a gift from my husband, Kerry, who thought I would enjoy being exposed to these exotic creatures far beyond my usual family of dogs and cats. Something happened during that weekend, some strange pull to these living relics from the dinosaur age who seem to know what we have forgotten about being wild and wise.<br><br>When I was a child, lost animals always seemed to find me-mostly cats and dogs but sometimes hamsters or guinea pigs. When I was six, I had a gopher friend for whom I would steal carrots from the refrigerator, then sneak outside to feed him in his burrow. Even after I became an adult, cats and dogs still gravitated to me, along with the occasional squirrel or raccoon. When I met Kerry, my family was small- one dog and one cat-but I warned him that more would show up; it was only a matter of time. Since our home is in the woods, the possibilities were endless. I'd recently rescued a baby squirrel who had fallen from its tree home and landed in the middle of our deck, where my numerous cats were circling for the kill. Wrapping him in a fluffy washcloth, I carried him in a sling that held him against my chest for warmth and a friendly heartbeat. I fed him mashed-up fruits, along with a little water, and he slowly regained his strength. After a few days, I took him to a stand of oak trees whose branches offered many possibilities for both a new home and safety from marauding cats.<br><br>But I had never owned an exotic animal, believing firmly that wild things belong in wild places. Peg Leg brought the point home. There in her five-by-four-foot cage, her wings could not fully extend to their nearly four-foot span. In the jungle from which she came, she would have flown above the leafy canopy, following air currents down to the river to take a drink or bathe. She was now somewhere between four and six years old, having been captured when she was approximately two. She had not flown or bathed in all that time. The method of her capture is no less sad. Although illegal today, the preferred method of capture has been parrot snares or nets, placed to trap unwary birds. In her case, the left foot became hopelessly tangled in the mesh and her captors were forced to cut off her left foot in order to release her. From there she had been shipped to a first-time breeder in Nebraska who had illusions of raising scores of little birds that would sell for as much as two thousand dollars each. The illusion didn't take account of the incessant screaming of two macaws who hated each other and refused to mate. In retaliation and frustration, the woman beat them with a stick poked through the bars. Saddened by her own behavior, the woman offered the birds to a local veterinarian who had contacts in California for wild bird rescues. Peg Leg and her mate then made their way to Samantha who added them to her other sixty or so birds, all wild-caught and all living in cages. Her aviary was under construction when I attended the Parrot Weekend, but even when completed it would be able to accommodate only fifteen to twenty birds; the rest would remain caged and, to my mind, spiritually broken. Peg Leg's scenario was even worse; she was sick with an infectious disease, so her cage was in isolation in a tiny laundry room. That was where I first met her.<br><br>When I had left for New York, I was not yet convinced that I could or would trade my African grey dream for a macaw nightmare. Kerry had offered to buy me a grey, planning to have the bird there for me when I returned. Still, there was something about Peg Leg's eyes that captivated me from our first meeting; that proud bird in a pitiful cage was beginning to unravel my dream. I told Kerry that I would leave the final decision up to him, since he was going to have to live with the bird, too. Both he and I agreed that birds should not be caged, so the temperament issue was crucial. Peg Leg was vicious, trying to bite whoever fed her through the bars. Was this a bird we could live with? What about our other animals-and those to come? What would happen if things didn't work out and we had to return her to Samantha? What to do, what to do?<br><br>We said yes.<br><br>chapter 2<br><br>we had to give Peg Leg a new name. She was a beautiful bird, a proud and fearless bird, a bird of grace. Peg Leg would never do. Kerry suggested "Sarah" because he thought it was a beautiful name. I agreed, because in Hebrew the name means "princess" and I thought she was one.<br><br>"Hello, Sarah; you are such a beautiful bird."<br><br>Over and over I repeated those words, rhythmically erasing the terrible sound of "Peg Leg." Even our two dogs, Ben and Blanco, seemed somehow reassured by the sound of her name coming from me, the one they loved and who fed them so well. Ben had been our first dog together after I moved onto Kerry's property. A rescue dog, he had been abandoned by his owners and wandered for months during the winter out on the road beyond our place. Taken to the Barking Lot, a local rescue facility for dogs and cats, he found himself in the caring hands of Audrey, who spent nearly two months stripping his badly matted fur. Mostly Tibetan Terrier, he looked nothing like his elegant heritage when I saw him in his dog run. "Last on the right," he had been with Audrey for six months; no one wanted to adopt him because he wasn't cute enough with his buzz-cut black-and-white body. It's always about the eyes. I looked at him, and we both knew. I named him Bentley, which soon became Ben, and I called him my little Buddha dog because he was so mellow and wise-looking. If Ben was Buddha, Blanco was Attila the Hun. Nicknamed Blanco the Killer Maltese Terrier, he was pure white and feared nothing-not other dogs, not cats, not raccoons, not deer, not even the occasional bear.<br><br>Our two house cats, Mr. Mistoffelees and Tiger, had bolted for the great outdoors when the cage arrived. Mistoff the Magnificent was far too diffident to care about another animal unless it encroached upon his food or petting time. Tiger was a rescue cat from our local McDonald's, where he had been fattening himself into fast-food obesity. When the cats did eventually saunter back inside, they looked up at the cage with a certain curiosity but not any kind of concern. As they say, "cage bars make good neighbors."<br><br>For several hours, I sat on the daybed across from the cage, reading and intoning my macaw mantra. I added that I loved her, even if I couldn't be sure that it would ever be true. I had never tried to love a creature whom I might never be able to touch or to share affection with. And the book I had bought didn't address how to rehabilitate a vicious bird; there mustn't be many humans who try. This was all new territory, and there were bound to be many mistakes. I only hoped none would involve the loss of a digit.<br><br>As dinnertime approached and Kerry was due to return from work, I went over to Sarah's cage to check on her food situation. All cages have swing-out dishes that lock from the outside. The challenge with a vicious bird is that it will try to bite you when you are opening or closing the gates. Kerry had devised a way to open the food dish door without jeopardizing a finger: a small metal "blocking plate" with a center-mounted knob that blocked the open gate while food or water was being dispensed, then raised as the dish went back into place. She still had plenty of food, but I decided to experiment with putting nuts through the bars directly into the dish. I'd have to be quick, but I knew I had to start building a relationship with Sarah. This was a good place to start.<br><br>I brought gifts for the goddess from the kitchen: almonds, walnut halves, and one peanut. With their high oil content, peanuts are very dangerous for birds as excessive oil can kill them. Birds should also never eat avocado or chocolate.<br><br>"Hi, Sarah; you're such a beautiful bird, and I love you. Would you like some nuts?"<br><br>I don't know if anyone else had offered her nuts; Samantha's bird diet was nut-free. Time to find out. Sarah watched me as I moved my hand toward the food dish; she didn't move one inch. Only her eyes followed my movements; hands, after all, were her enemies.<br><br>"Treats for Sarah, treats for Sarah." The word treat must have cross- species universality because all of my animals have understood that word immediately.<br><br>She still hadn't moved, so I cautiously, fearfully, tossed an almond into the dish. Then a walnut half, more almonds, and finally the peanut. She still didn't move. I backed away from the cage and moved onto the daybed to see what she would do. Nothing. This might be harder than I thought. I decided to look away and feign interest in something else. After a few very long seconds, I noticed, out of the corner of my eye, Sarah moving very slowly sideways on her perch toward the treats. Success! The peanut went first, and as I turned my head to watch more closely I could see her pupil become a pinpoint of excitement. When she had finished all the nuts, she swooshed her beak back and forth in the dish. It looked to me like a little bit of happiness.<br><br>Maybe, just maybe, this would work.<br><br>chapter 3<br><br>despite samantha's warning that Sarah could scream loud enough to make a human chest vibrate, she had not done so with me. The telephone call that changed everything was from an editor who was making me an offer on a new book. Sarah was quiet, and I listened as the editor outlined the preliminary terms. The advance was less than I had hoped for, and my voice must have reflected that disappointment. Before I could respond?.?.?.<br><br>"Crap! It's crap!"<br><br>"What?" she asked. "What you you mean it's crap?"<br><br>"No, no," I assured her. "I didn't say it was crap, the bird did!"<br><br>"The bird? What do you mean, the bird?"<br><br>I explained that I had just acquired a macaw, that my separate office cottage wasn't yet ready (my husband was the contractor), and that I was handling my business calls in the house-with a bird that I hadn't known had any vocabulary skills, until now. She laughed. Still, the disappointment in my voice when she made a slightly higher offer did not go unnoticed.<br><br>"Bummer, it's a bummer!"<br><br>What? How many other words did Sarah know? Had she been captured by a group of hippies whose lingo would now punctuate my every day?<br><br>I groaned; the editor laughed again.<br><br>"Well," she said, "I've never done business with a bird before. Will she be overseeing the contract negotiations as well?"<br><br>We ended our conversation in laughter, and I turned to Sarah, who had now become quiet as the proverbial mouse. She gave me a look that said in no uncertain terms, "That's only the beginning."<br><br>The "beginning" extended to liberal use of "crap," "bummer," and "bad bird"-all expressed in her best earsplitting voice and always at the most unexpected moments. Feeding time in particular became an adventure.<br><br>"Kerry, would you please feed Sarah? It's nearly thirty minutes later than what she's used to, and I'm trying to talk on the phone."<br><br>With me, she would lower her head slowly to one side, then to the other, while I fed her. I learned that this is a sign of affection and "equality" among macaws, and I was delighted. She stopped trying to bite my hand when I fed her, and I was able to abandon the metal plate, which Kerry still had to use. Mostly I fed her, but he fed her on an occasional basis so that she would be accustomed to him when I was on business trips. For him, that little shield was a necessity. His antics reminded me of the three hundred Spartans up against the Persians, shields held strategically in place. Most of the time it worked, but Sarah was a clever little Persian and he was sustaining battle wounds. Beyond that, she had no interest in him. All macaws choose one mate, and that's it. I was in; Kerry was out. He accepted that she was my bird and gave up on having any kind of intimate relationship with her.<br><br>"Crap, crap, crap!"<br><br>My head was starting to throb, and I was catching only one word out of every two or three from my client.<br><br>"Bad bird, bad bird!"</p><h2>Purls of Wisdom</h2><p>With the clearest instructions and pictures, and with Jenny Lord as your knitting tutor, Purls of Wisdom: The Book of Knitting will teach you to knit in a series of simple steps.

The hero of her story is young Trevor McKinney, a 12-year-old whose imagination is sparked by an extra-credit assignment in Social Studies: "Think of an idea for world change, and put it into action." Trevor's idea is deceptively simple: do a good deed for three people, and in exchange, ask each of them to "pay it forward" to three more. "So nine people get helped. Then those people have to do twenty-seven.... Then it sort of spreads out." Trevor's early attempts to get his project off the ground seem to end in failure: a junkie he befriends ends up back in jail; an elderly woman whose garden he tends dies unexpectedly. But even after the boy has given up on his plan, his acts of kindness bear unexpected fruit, and soon an entire movement is underway and spreading across America.<p> Trevor, meanwhile, could use a little help himself. His father walked out on the family, and his mother, Arlene, is fighting an uphill battle with alcoholism, poor judgment in men, and despair. When the boy's new Social Studies teacher, Reuben St. Clair, arrives on the scene, Trevor sees in him not only a source of inspiration for how to change the world, but also the means of altering his mother's life. Yet Reuben has his own set of problems. Horribly scarred in Vietnam, he is reluctant to open himself up to the possibility of rejection--or love. Indeed, the relationship between Arlene and Reuben is central to the novel as these two damaged people learn to "pay forward" the trust and affection Trevor has given them.</p><p> Hyde tells her tale from many different perspectives, using letters, diary entries, and first- and third-person narratives from the various people whose lives Trevor's project touches. Jerry Busconi, for example, the addict Trevor tried to help, one night finds himself talking a young woman out of jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge: </p><blockquote> I'm a junkie, Charlotte. I'm always gonna be a junkie. I ain't never gonna be no fine, upstanding citizen. But then I thought, hell. Just pay it forward anyway. Kid tried to help me. Okay, it didn't work. Still, I'm trying to help you. Maybe you'll jump. I don't know. But I tried, right? But let me tell you one thing. I woke up one morning and somebody gave me a chance. Just outta nowhere. It was like a miracle. Now, how do you know that won't happen to you tomorrow? </blockquote> <i>Pay It Forward</i> is reminiscent of Frank Capra's classic <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i>. Like the film, this novel has a steely core of gritty reality beneath its optimism: yes, one person <i>can</i> make a difference, can help to make the world a better place, but sickness, pain, heartache, and tragedy will still always be a part of the human condition. If at times Hyde stumbles a bit while negotiating the razor-thin line between honest feeling and sentimentality, it's generally not for long. And the occasional lapse into artificially colored emotion can be forgiven when weighed against the courage it takes to write so unabashedly hopeful a story in such cynical times. <i>--Sheila Bright</i><b>Catherine Ryan Hyde</b> is the author of the critically acclaimed novel <i>Funerals for Horses</i> and numerous short stories, including the collection <i>Earthquake Weather.</i> She lives in Cambria, California.</p><h2>He-Said-She-Said: Talk as Social Organization among Black Children</h2><p><p>... carefully researched and clearly written...

He climbed with an audacity and panache that epitomized the purest spirit of alpinism, and inspired an entire generation of climbers. Jon Krakauer calls him one of my heroes. He is not only a mountaineer of astonishing talent and vision, but one of the world's most engaging writers about mountaineering.<br><br>Bonatti has also been dogged by controversy and often been at odds with the climbing community. <b>The Mountains of My Life</b> not only collects the best of Bonatti's writing telling of adventures in the Alps, the Himalayas, and little-known South American peaks it also tells Bonatti's version of what really happened on the Italian expedition that made the first ascent of K2 in 1954.

There, for reasons that are unclear, the 24-year-old ran afoul of senior members of the team, who accused him of turning back before delivering needed oxygen to them below the summit. Accusations and counteraccusations flew, followed by a libel trial from which Bonatti emerged victorious but ostracized. He went on to bag a few peaks, retired from "extreme" climbing in 1965, and became an accomplished explorer and photojournalist, writing memoirs of his earlier expeditions to mountains on nearly every continent that earned a small but devoted following.<p> In <i>The Mountains of My Life</i>, translator and editor Robert Marshall gathers those scattered accounts of ascents in the Alps, the Patagonian Andes, the Himalayas, and elsewhere. In his commentary, he describes and defends Bonatti's actions on K2, which, he insists, made it possible for the Italian team to reach the summit. The evidence he offers--including photographs--is convincing. For his part, Bonatti writes that all the mountains he has climbed, "with all the trials they brought me, are a precious, living part of myself." His book will be of interest to anyone who shares that passion for the world's high places. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>"Bonatti's voice reaches us from another world. . . .

Originally a rebel leader, Josephus changed sides after he was captured to become a Rome-appointed negotiator, and so was uniquely placed to observe these turbulent events, from the siege of Jerusalem to the final heroic resistance and mass suicides at Masada. His account provides much of what we know about the history of the Jews under Roman rule, with vivid portraits of such key figures as the Emperor Vespasian and Herod the Great. Often self-justifying and divided in its loyalties, &#34;The Jewish War&#34; nevertheless remains one of the most immediate accounts of war, its heroism and its horrors, ever written.</p><p>Josephus was born in 37 AD.

The distillation of more than two thousand years of practical techniques for enhancing sexual awareness and achieving the transcendental experience of unity, <em>Sexual Secrets</em> explores the path of love and mysticism, making accessible the sexual mysteries of the East. <br> <br>In India, Nepal, Tibet, China, and Japan, sexuality has long been regarded as both an art and a science worthy of detailed study and practice. Virtually unknown to the Western world, a vast and potent body of ancient sacred writings on sexuality exists. The secrets for consciously inducing and maximizing the experience of ecstasy have remained sealed in the ancient texts and art of the East. <em>Sexual Secrets</em> makes available the essential core of this vast literature on sexual wisdom in a vital and practical form. It is meant to be experienced as well as read, for it is the sharing of ecstatic love that unlocks the sexual secrets.<em> <br></em> <br>THE RICHEST COLLECTION OF EROTIC ART EVER ASSEMBLED<em> <br></em>More than six hundred color and black-and-white paintings and illustrations have been created and collected to enhance the experience of the text and to unfold these sacred mysteries. The illustrations and paintings in <em>Sexual Secrets </em>are the most comprehensive and diverse collection of images expressing the erotic sentiment ever assembled. Two hundred different sexual postures are depicted, creating a complete illustrated <em>Kama Sutra</em>, <em>Ananga Ranga</em>, and the major Taoist love treatises. These works of art are unique in themselves and represent, as does the text, a gathering together of<em> </em>many streams, leading to the same source--the celebration of sacred sexuality. <em>Sexual Secrets</em> reveals the wisdom of the sages whose teachings on sexuality have stood the test of twenty centuries and, even today, show how physical love can become the pathway to liberation.<em> <br> <br></em>NIK DOUGLAS<em> <br></em>Nik Douglas studied Oriental art, philosophy, medicine, and related sexual practices while living for eight years in the Himalayas.

In it, Fanny Fern (Sara Payson Willis Parton) portrays a mid-nineteenth-century woman who realizes the American Dream solely on her own becoming the incarnation of the American individualist-regarded at that time as a role designed exclusively for men. Based on the author's life, the novel reflects her spirit of practical feminism-that a woman was only truly independent when she was financially independent.<p>Fanny Fern was one of the most popular American writers of the mid-nineteenth century, the first woman newspaper columnist in the United States, and the most highly paid newspaper writer of her day. This volume gathers together for the first time almost one hundred selections of her best work as a journalist. Writing on such taboo subjects as prostitution, venereal disease, divorce, and birth control, Fern stripped the fa�ade of convention from some of society's most sacred institutions, targeting cant and hypocrisy, pretentiousness and pomp.</p><p>Fern portrays a mid-nineteenth century woman who becomes the incarnartion of the American individualist, something regarded as exclusively for men.</p></p><p>Joyce W. Warren is an associate professor of English and director of Women's Studies at Queens College of the City University of New York. She is the author of <i>The American Narcissus</i> and <i>Fanny Fern</i>, and editor of<i></i><i>The (Other) American Traditions </i>and <i>Challenging Boundaries</i>."[This work] is complex, full of quirky ironies and subtle sarcasm, and, above all, it is fun!" -- <i>Belies Lettres</i><br><br>In 1852, Fanny Fern became the first woman regular newspaper columnist in the United States; by 1855 she was the most highly paid newspaper writer in the country, male or female. While she was capable of producing the tear-jerking prose popular in her time, she was most famous for her biting, satirical commentary on everything from the weather to marriage to a woman's right to her own children. <b>Ruth Hall</b>, her first novel, is largely autobiographical and contains scathing portraits of her father, in-laws, and brother (the poet Nathaniel P. Willis) which earned her much criticism for her "unfeminine" attitude. The book concerns a young, happily married woman whose husband dies suddenly, leaving her with two children and no money. Neither set of parents is forthcoming with financial assistance and Ruth is left to fend for herself, which, after much trial, she does admirably, eventually establishing a name for herself as a writer. Hers is a female version of the American Dream, and Fanny Fern is careful to note exactly why that dream is more difficult for women to attain. She is just as careful not to let her heroine's success and security lie in marriage - Ruth succeeds on her own, with her children, usually without the help of men. She is a wonderful character, and Fanny Fern's prose sparkles with a delightful viciousness. Revenge can be sweet, and for Fanny Fern it was highly profitable as well: in its first few years <b>Ruth Hall</b> sold more than 70,000 copies. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Erica Bauermeister</i></p><h2>Picture Postcards in the United States, 1893-1918</h2><p>A thorough study of the early development of the postcard in America reveals its importance as a source of historical data and as a unique form of folk art</p><p></p><h2>Night Train</h2><p>Detective Mike Hoolihan has seen it all. A fifteen-year veteran of the force, she's gone from walking a beat, to robbery, to homicide. But one case--this case--has gotten under her skin.<br><br>When Jennifer Rockwell, darling of the community and daughter of a respected career cop--now top brass--takes her own life, no one is prepared to believe it. Especially her father, Colonel Tom. Homicide Detective Mike Hoolihan, longtime colleague and friend of Colonel Tom, is ready to "put the case down." Suicide. Closed. Until Colonel Tom asks her to do the one thing any grieving father would ask: take a second look.<br><br>Not since his celebrated novel Money has Amis turned his focus on America to such remarkable effect. Fusing brilliant wordplay with all the elements of a classic whodunit, Amis exposes a world where surfaces are suspect (no matter how perfect), where paranoia is justified (no matter how pervasive), and where power and pride are brought low by the hidden recesses of our humanity.</p><p>On a beautiful night in a second-tier American city, a beautiful astrophysicist with the clich�d everything to live for shoots herself dead with a .22. Tough-talking detective Mike Hoolihan, quickly summoned to the scene, has witnessed every sort of victim: "Jumpers, stumpers, dumpers, dunkers, bleeders, floaters, poppers, bursters." But this case is different. Mike has known the young woman for years--she's the daughter, it turns out, of Mike's mentor, Colonel Tom Rockwell. And the colonel is desperate to find a perp, despite massive evidence to the contrary. <p> In <i>Night Train</i>, Martin Amis has fixed his sights on the American female--with a difference. Mike is in fact a woman--a hulking, chain-smoking, deep-voiced alcoholic who comes complete with a squalid family background and a none-too-happy foreground. She even lives in a building next to the proverbial night train and can't survive without her tape with eight different versions of the R &amp; B "hymn to the low rent." </p><p> Did this novel begin as narrative flexing, yet another test the hypertalented author--and number-one Elmore Leonard fan--wanted to pose to himself? If so, he has passed with flying colors. True, Mike's search occasionally pushes her up against pulp pathos, but mostly the genre keeps Amis true. "Police are pretty blas� about ballistics. Remember the Kennedy assassination and 'the magic bullet'? We know that every bullet is a magic bullet. Particularly the .22 roundnose. When a bullet enters a human being, it has hysterics. As if it knows it shouldn't be there." </p><p> Mike spends her time weighing the evidence, wishing it would point to murder, and letting us in on some current police realities. Whatever television tells us, in real life (not to mention postmodern crime fiction), there's no neat solution. Even that old standard, the good cop-bad cop approach, no longer works: "It's not just that Joe Perp is on to it, having seen good cop-bad cop a million times on reruns of <i>Hawaii Five-O</i>. The only time bad cop was any good was in the old days, when he used to come into the interrogation room every ten minutes and smash your suspect over the head with the yellow pages." With such discourses, Amis is stretching the rubber band of his book's realism. But in the end, all his fancy footwork doesn't stop us from admiring and pitying his heroine, and hoping she won't board the ultimate night train: suicide.</p>"In my time, I have come in on the aftermath of maybe a thousand suspicious deaths, most of which turned out to be suicides or accidentals or plain unattendeds. So I've seen them all: Jumpers, stumpers, dumpers, dunkers, bleeders, floaters, poppers, bursters. But of all the bodies I have ever seen, none has stayed with me, in the gut, like the body of Jennifer Rockwell."<br><br>"I say all this because I am part of the story I am going to tell, and I feel the need to give some idea of where I'm coming from."<br>-Mike Hoolihan, Detective Night Train</p><h2>Collage : A New Approach</h2><p>This book describes a new technique, developed by the author, which makes it possible to adhere collage elements without liquid adhesives.

She lives in England.The best critical biography of Plath yet, poet Stevenson's ( The Fiction Makers ) volume offers a convincing reinterpretation of a complex and controversial life. The author's objectivity and her success in assembling new sources pay off richly: bombarded by a superbly orchestrated array of opinions, quotations, details and anecdotes from Plath and those who knew her (Ted Hughes, Plath's husband, provided background information and reviewed the manuscript for factual accuracy), we are enabled, with Stevenson's guidance, to draw fresh conclusions about the late poet's conflicts between her fierce drive to succeed and keen appetite for self-destruction. Of particular significance is Stevenson's effort to present needed balance in portraying the marriage of Hughes and Plath; no longer cast as a victim of her husband's alleged infidelities (largely imagined, the book asserts), Plath emerges as the forger of her own fate leading to her 1963 suicide. Essays written in remembrance of Plath by Lucas Myers, Dido Merwin and Richard Murphy provide striking, invaluable firsthand views.

Mid-century concepts of national consensus, managed markets, gender and racial identities, citizen obligation, and historical memory became more fluid. Flexible markets pushed aside Keynesian macroeconomic structures. Racial and gender solidarity divided into multiple identities; community responsibility shrank to smaller circles. In this wide-ranging narrative, <b>Daniel Rodgers</b> shows how the collective purposes and meanings that had framed social debate became unhinged and uncertain. <br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br><i>Age of Fracture</i> offers a powerful reinterpretation of the ways in which the decades surrounding the 1980s changed America. Through a contagion of visions and metaphors, on both the intellectual right and the intellectual left, earlier notions of history and society that stressed solidity, collective institutions, and social circumstances gave way to a more individualized human nature that emphasized choice, agency, performance, and desire. On a broad canvas that includes Michel Foucault, Ronald Reagan, Judith Butler, Charles Murray, Jeffrey Sachs, and many more, Rodgers explains how structures of power came to seem less important than market choice and fluid selves.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br>Cutting across the social and political arenas of late-twentieth-century life and thought, from economic theory and the culture wars to disputes over poverty, color-blindness, and sisterhood, Rodgers reveals how our categories of social reality have been fractured and destabilized. As we survey the intellectual wreckage of this war of ideas, we better understand the emergence of our present age of uncertainty.<br></p></p><p>Daniel T. Rodgers is Henry Charles Lea Professor of History at Princeton University.<i>Age of Fracture</i> is an extraordinary book -- an engrossing story of the new age of markets, a new kind of history of ideas, traversing the frontiers between intellectual, political and public words, and a brilliant explanation of contemporary public life.

(James Kloppenberg, author of <i>Reading Obama</i>)<br><br>Rodgers offers a series of penetrating soundings into the social thought of the end of the twentieth century. He considers the recasting of terms in economic theory, the reconceptualizations of power in social theory, the attacks on "essentialism" in race and gender theory, and the diminished notions of obligation in political theory. Finally, he stresses our own curious encounters with the disaggregated past, via glib interpretations that impart an "increasingly malleable, flexible, and porous" quality to history...Again and again in the dominant modes of thought in these years, Rodgers finds institutions, identities, social bonds, and even history itself thinning out and coming apart. (Robert Westbrook <i>Bookforum</i> 2010-12-01)<br><br>While Rodgers' narrative about the right is fascinating, none of it is terribly surprising: Defending the prerogatives of corporations and the wealthy, in new and novel ways, is what conservatives do. <i>Age of Fracture</i> provokes by showing that just as conservatives were marshaling their intellectual and philanthropic forces for what New Right gladiator Paul Weyrich called "a war of ideology...a war of ideas, it's a war about our way of life," liberals and progressives themselves "fractured" instead...Rodgers acknowledges both the long, shameful history of oppression as well as the thrilling cultural and political ferment that fractured the left into separate, sometimes warring mini-caucuses. But the book makes it clear that those fissures left liberalism without the ideology or rhetoric to combat the language of choice, markets and freedom that replaced social responsibility in the Reagan years. (Joan Walsh <i>Salon</i> 2011-01-04)<br><br>Rodgers offers a challenging interdisciplinary overview of the last quarter of the 20th century...The great value of this book is that the major contentious issues of our time are discussed within a historic and intellectual framework...Rodgers's work may not enter the vernacular like David Riesman's <i>The Lonely Crowd</i>, but it's a similarly seminal look at the way we live (and govern) now. (Thomas A. Karel <i>Library Journal</i> 2011-01-01)<br><br>Rodgers has a knack for characterizing and assessing ideas without reducing them to their strictly polemical dimensions. But he also conveys the urgency and consequence of intellectual debate: the sense that it has stakes...<i>Age of Fracture</i> provides a frequently insightful narrative of recent public intellectual life in this country--and also some understanding of its precarious situation now. (Scott McLemee <i>The National</i> 2011-02-18)<br><br>A blend of commentary and contextualization, admirably judicious. Rodgers is an excellent anatomist. His forte is clarity. Once in a while, he delivers himself of an opinion that seems positively clairvoyant. (Alex Danchev <i>Times Higher Education</i> 2011-03-10)<br><br>I live in a different country than the one into which I was born in 1942. I have never been quite able to pinpoint exactly what makes it so different. More than any other book I've read in recent years, <i>Age of Fracture</i>, by the Princeton historian Daniel T. Rodgers, has helped me to discover and to understand that difference...His ability to explain complex ideas--the Coase theorem comes to mind--is exemplary. He is unapologetic about treating intellectuals, and even academics, as producers of ideas worth taking seriously. He has the ability, unusual for historians of our day, to engage directly in current debates and to write with the clarity of a future observer of these same events. Intellectual history is never that easy to do. An intellectual history of our own time is even harder to pull off. Rodgers has done it and done it well. Perhaps, then, this book will have the happy effect of bringing to an end the trends it brings to light. Rodgers writes about our descent into thinking small because he wants us to once again think big--or so I read between his lines. If more thinkers wrote books like this, the country in which I live may once again resemble the one in which I was born. How sweet that would be.

Over 400,000 people were cut off from the outside world in the ghetto, among them a 47-year-old school teacher who kept a record of the terrible events and conditions. Part of Abraham Lewin&#39;s diary, covering the period from April 1942 to January 1943, was found hidden in a milk churn after the war and is now published in English for the first time. This document, fit to rank with the accounts of Anne Frank and of Emanuel Ringelblum, is especially illuminating on how far the Jews were aware of their possible fate and on how they reacted to the threat of deportation to the death camps. Antony Polonsky&#39;s introduction and notes place the events in the history of the Warsaw Ghetto and the fate of Polish Jewry as a whole, and demonstrate how Lewin&#39;s diary is an important contribution to the knowledge of the Holocaust.</p><p>Text: English (translation)A secondary-school teacher born to Hasidic parents, Lewin helped build and maintain the underground archives in the Warsaw ghetto and is presumed to have died just before or during the tragic ghetto uprising. His diary, translated into English for the first time, is a powerful and important document that rings with the moral force and literary skill of an Old Testament prophet. The sections preserved cover only the period from April 1942 to January 1943, but Lewin hears all, sees all, records all: the starvation and disease, the desperate grasping for signs of hope; the cooperation among Poles and Jews; the children smuggling food; the slaughter of Jews in surrounding communities and then in the sealed-off Warsaw ghetto; the daily deportations to the Treblinka death camp (which took his wife from him). Lewin's absolute clarity of vision gives this grim document compelling power. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Assassin&#39;s Silence: A David Slaton Novel (David Slaton, 2)</h2><p><p><i>USA Today </i>bestselling author Ward Larsen's celebrated protagonist, assassin David Slaton, returns for another breathless adventure in <i>Assassin's Silence.</i></p><p> When it comes to disappearing, David Slaton has few equals.

He has worked in Italy and the US, and is currently directing the quantum gravity research group of the Centre de physique theorique in Marseille, France. His Seven Brief Lessons on Physics is an international bestseller translated into forty-one languages.From the First Lesson: <i>The Most Beautiful of Theories</i><br><br>In his youth Albert Einstein spent a year loafing aimlessly. You don&#x2019;t get anywhere by not &#x201c;wasting&#x201d; time&#x2014;something, unfortunately, that the parents of teenagers tend frequently to forget. He was in Pavia. He had joined his family, having abandoned his studies in Germany, unable to endure the rigors of his high school there. It was the beginning of the twentieth century, and in Italy the beginning of its industrial revolution. His father, an engineer, was installing the first electricitygenerating power plants in the Paduan plains. Albert was reading Kant and attending occasional lectures at the University of Pavia: for pleasure, without being registered there or having to think about exams. It is thus that serious scientists are made.<br><br>After this he registered at the University of Zurich and immersed himself in the study of physics. A few years later, in 1905, he sent three articles to the most prestigious scientific journal of the period, the Annalen der Physik. Each of these is worthy of a Nobel Prize. The first shows that atoms really exist. The second lays the first foundation for quantum mechanics, which I will discuss in the next lesson. The third presents his first theory of relativity (known today as &#x201c;special relativity&#x201d;), the theory that elucidates how time does not pass identically for everyone: two identical twins find that they are different in age if one of them has traveled at speed. <br><br>Einstein became a renowned scientist overnight and received offers of employment from various universities. But something disturbed him: despite its immediate acclaim, his theory of relativity does not fit with what we know about gravity, namely, with how things fall. He came to realize this when writing an article summarizing his theory and began to wonder if the law of &#x201c;universal gravity&#x201d; as formulated by the father of physics himself, Isaac Newton, was in need of revision in order to make it compatible with the new concept of relativity. He immersed himself in the problem. It would take ten years to resolve. Ten years of frenzied studies, attempts, errors, confusion, mistaken articles, brilliant ideas, misconceived ideas.<br><br>Finally, in November 1915, he committed to print an article giving the complete solution: a new theory of gravity, which he called &#x201c;The General Theory of Relativity,&#x201d; his masterpiece and the &#x201c;most beautiful of theories,&#x201d; according to the great Russian physicist Lev Landau.<br><br>There are absolute masterpieces that move us intensely: Mozart&#x2019;s Requiem, Homer&#x2019;s Odyssey, the Sistine Chapel, King Lear. To fully appreciate their brilliance may require a long apprenticeship, but the reward is sheer beauty&#x2014;and not only this, but the opening of our eyes to a new perspective upon the world. Einstein&#x2019;s jewel, the general theory of relativity, is a masterpiece of this order.</p><h2>See Inside Castles</h2><p>Describes different types of castles and what life was like in them, in a book with information hidden beneath the flaps.

Wendy Orr is also the author of <i>Peeling the Onion, </i>an ALA Best Book for Young Adults.In a palm tree, on an island, in the middle of the wide blue sea, is a girl.<br>Nim's hair is wild, her eyes are bright, and around her neck she wears three cords. One is for a spyglass, one is for a whorly, whistling shell, and the other holds a fat red pocketknife in a sheath.<br>With the spyglass at her eye, Nim watched the little red seaplane depart. It sailed out through the reef to the deeper dark ocean, bumping across the waves till it was tossed into the bright blue sky. Then it rose so high and so far it was nothing but a speck, and floated out of sight.<br>"Alex is gone," Nim told Fred.<br>Fred stared at the coconuts clustered on the trunk.<br>Fred is an iguana, spiky as a dragon, with a cheerful snub nose. He was sitting on Nim's shoulder, and he cared more about coconuts than he did about saying goodbye. (Marine iguanas don't eat coconut, but no one has ever told Fred.)<br>As Nim threw three ripe coconuts thump! into the sand, she remembered Alex saying, "I never knew anything could taste better than coffee!" the first time Nim opened a coconut for her.<br>Nim looked down at her father, sitting like a stone on Selkie's Rock. Jack's head was bowed and his shoulders slumped. Nim had never seen him look so sad.<br>And suddenly she knew she'd made a terrible, terrible mistake.<br>The mistake began when she answered Alex's very first e-mail, back when she'd thought that the famous Alex Rover was a man and a brave adventurer like the hero in the books "he" wrote. That led to Alex's ending up on the island--and when she did, Jack and Nim wanted her never to leave. Sometimes it felt good to be three instead of two.<br>But other times Nim wanted Jack just for herself, the way it used to be. Or she wanted Alex just for herself, because Alex was her friend before she was Jack's. Sometimes, when Alex and Jack told Nim to go to sleep while they talked late into the night, Nim felt left out and lonely.<br>Then, earlier this morning, the little red seaplane had arrived, bringing all the things that Alex had asked her editor back in the city to send. It was the first time a plane had ever landed on Nim's island. Nim could tell that Jack was worried that the pilot would notice how beautiful the island was and would want to come back again and again.<br>Whenever Jack was worried, Nim was too. And when Nim was worried, so were her friends Selkie and Fred. (Selkie is a sea lion who sometimes forgets that Nim is a girl and not a little sea lion pup to be looked after and whuffled over.) They both stuck close to Nim every time she walked back and forth between the plane and the hut.<br>"I've never seen animals do that before!" exclaimed the pilot.<br>Nim didn't know what to say, partly because she didn't know exactly what he hadn't seen before, and partly because she'd never spoken to any person besides Jack and Alex. She grabbed a crate and opened it up. Inside there were books! Thin books and fat, short books and tall, history books and science, mysteries, adventures, and more and more and more! Nim started to look through one when--<br>"Come on, Nim!" said Alex. "There'll be time to read when everything's off the plane."<br>The pilot pulled out two big solar panels. "Great!" Jack exclaimed, because he wanted them for the new room he planned to add to the hut--one created especially for Alex to write her books in. Jack balanced the panels on his head and walked very slowly and carefully up toward the hut.<br>"Who's going to take this one?" the pilot asked, pointing to a crate.<br>Nim stepped forward eagerly. But just as she was about to reach for the crate, the pilot handed it to Alex. First Alex stumbled, then she tripped, then crash! the crate fell with a tinkle of broken glass.<br>"Oh, no!" Alex wailed. "What have I done?"<br>"Jack's test tubes!" Nim shouted. "You should have let me take it!"<br>"I was trying to help!"<br>"But I didn't need help! You just got in the way!"<br>"I'm always in the way these days!" Alex snapped. "Maybe you and Jack would be better off without me."<br>"I think we would!" Nim shouted, and stomped off without waiting for an answer.<br>She's right! Alex thought. Nim and Jack lived here perfectly happily all those years without anyone else--they don't really need me. Nim's been cross with me a lot lately and I've never seen Jack be so worried. I think . . . I think I'm changing their lives too much. What if they've secretly been wanting their old lives back--and just haven't wanted to say so?<br>Alex understood about being afraid to say so. Before she came to the island, she was so afraid of saying anything to anyone that she hardly ever left her apartment. She was a famous person, but only through her books. Her life had totally changed since she flew across the world to find Nim.<br>"Last one!" The pilot handed her a large envelope. "And now, time for me to go."<br>Alex opened it. She pulled out the letter and stared at it without reading.<br>"Wait! Can I . . . can I go with you?"<br>"Sure!" said the pilot. "But don't you need to pack?"<br>Alex knew that if she saw Jack or Nim she would never be able to leave, even if it was the right thing to do. "No," she said, "I'm ready to go."<br>Alex Rover climbed into the little red seaplane. And was gone.</p><h2>I Lost My Girlish Laughter</h2><p><b><b>A lost literary gem of Hollywood in the 1930s, <i>I Lost My Girlish Laughter</i>&nbsp;is a thinly veiled send-up of the actors, producers, writers, and directors of the Golden Age of the studio system.</b></b><br><br>Madge Lawrence, fresh from New York City, lands a job as the personal secretary to the powerful Hollywood producer Sidney Brand (based on the legendary David O.

Your town meeting is populated and you&#x2019;re ready to spend the next nine months in the womb, interacting with your prenatal environment&#x2013;amniotic fluid, placenta, and a host of other influences. You&#x2019;ll also respond to your prenatal &#x201c;diet&#x201d;&#x2013;the nutrition you take in through what your mother eats and makes available to you. So right from the beginning, your town meeting is under way, with diet, environment, and genes beginning their lively debate.<br><br>This debate has enormous significance for the being who will emerge into the world nine months later. For example, your genetic potential at conception encoded a certain range of arterial flexibility. But how strong will your arteries be, and how flexible? A lot of the answers to those questions depend on what happens in the womb.<br><br>So that&#x2019;s one of your first town meetings. The genes that encode the delicate branching architecture of your nerves and arteries show up, ready to take part. And there are our friends, environment and diet, up there on the platform as they will be throughout your life, helping your &#x201c;cardiovascular genes&#x201d; and &#x201c;nerve genes&#x201d; decide what to do. A good diet with lots of protein and healthy fats will encourage your artery genes to make your arteries rugged and elastic. On the other hand, if your mother is unlucky enough to be living in a famine, your &#x201c;artery genes&#x201d; will have to compete for those scarce nutrients with the genes that control the growth of other organs and tissues. The result might be a greater tendency for heart disease or high blood pressure. As you can see, the same genes are always at the meeting, but they&#x2019;re responding very differently to the information given by diet and environment.<br><br>Obviously, the health of your arteries is only one of the ways that your tissues and organs are affected by your time in the womb. Those crucial nine months help determine whether you gain weight at the drop of a hat or lose weight far too easily. They help nudge you toward a hair-trigger immune response that views the entire world as its enemy, or toward a welcoming immune response that may not always know which invaders to turn away. They predispose you to certain foods that you&#x2019;ll be able to digest easily and turn you away from others that won&#x2019;t suit your particular metabolism and digestive tract. Right from the beginning, your genes interact with diet (in this case, Mom&#x2019;s) and environment (in this case, the womb) to determine who you are.<br><br>And then you&#x2019;re born. This is the point at which your GenoType is determined. Your GenoType represents your survival strategy, the decisions that have been reached collectively among your genetic potential, your prenatal diet, and your environment. Although the town meeting will continue for the rest of your life, with genes getting louder and softer in response to diet and environment, certain elements of this meeting are now fixed. They&#x2019;ve formed certain patterns&#x2013;one of six patterns, to be exact, which I&#x2019;ve identified as the six human GenoTypes.<br><b>GenoTypes: A Human Survival Strategy<br></b><br>So far, we&#x2019;ve been telling the story from an individual point of view&#x2013;yours, to be exact. But since everyone in the world falls into one of those six GenoTypes, let&#x2019;s step back for a moment and see where these GenoTypes came from.<br><br>In the beginning was the environment&#x2013;a challenging place for our ancestors, to be sure. People had to make sure they could get enough food, that they could survive whatever climate they were born in or migrated to, and that they could resist infections from microbes, bacteria, and viruses.<br><br>Genetic inheritance played a crucial role in this survival. People with helpful genes survived; people with less helpful genes died. You&#x2019;ve probably heard of this particular aspect of evolution as &#x201c;survival of the fittest.&#x201d; <br><br>Actually, survival of the fittest is more a fantasy than a reality. If only we humans were the fittest possible examples of our species, we&#x2019;d all be a lot healthier, and I might be out of a job! In fact, evolution is more like a game of chance than any true contest. Sometimes the good players win; sometimes it&#x2019;s just the lucky ones who survive. Sure, a lot of our genetic inheritance helps us beat the odds, but there&#x2019;s also a big chunk of it that gets in our way or doesn&#x2019;t play any useful role at all:<br><br><b>1. Sometimes the &#x201c;good genes&#x201d; that help us survive also have their downside</b>. The genes that instruct our immune systems to react swiftly to bacterial invasion also overreact to produce allergies, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. The genes that instruct our fat cells to hang on to every calorie in order to survive a famine also contribute to obesity and diabetes. The genes that program our immune systems to respond calmly to the environment, enabling us to tolerate a wide set of circumstances without getting sick, also tell that immune system to tolerate some deadly invaders that it ought to repel.<br><br><b>2. Sometimes mutations simply &#x201c;happen.&#x201d;</b> Our genes are designed to reproduce themselves in exact copies, but of course, that&#x2019;s not always how it works. Sometimes a gene reproduces slightly differently and that variation becomes part of our genetic heritage. Skin color probably emerged this way, as a mutation of the gene that determines skin pigment. Although originally we all had dark skin, those of us living in northern climates were better able to absorb vitamin D from the scarce sunlight if our skin was lighter; we also had less need of the darker pigment&#x2019;s protective function. So having lighter skin was a mutation that survived because it actually did contribute to our survival. <br><br>To some extent, though, these mutations were just random, such as the mutations that produced such diseases as Huntington&#x2019;s chorea or Tay-Sachs. Or, sometimes, they represent a trade-off between the lesser of two evils. For example, having sickle-cell anemia seems to be somewhat protective against malaria, so people with the genetic tendency to have one disease are meanwhile being protected against another.<br><br>As you can see, some mutations make our lives better, some make them worse, and some probably don&#x2019;t make much difference either way. But the &#x201c;bad&#x201d; or &#x201c;neutral&#x201d;mutations don&#x2019;t necessarily die out, and as we&#x2019;ll see in a moment, the good ones don&#x2019;t necessarily survive.<br><br><b>3. Sometimes who survives is just the luck of the draw</b>. If all the strong young men die in a huge battle, the male survivors are not necessarily the healthiest&#x2013;but they will have lived the longest. If an avalanche destroys three-fourths of a village, the remaining one-fourth who stagger down the mountain may be more lucky than fit. There is also what scientists call the &#x201c;founder effect&#x201d;: When a small group splits off from a larger group and migrates to a distant land, its members may carry only a fraction of the original population&#x2019;s genetic potential. Whatever genes they managed to take away from the larger group, those are the ones that survive&#x2013;and they&#x2019;re not necessarily &#x201c;the fittest.&#x201d; Nevertheless, these are the survivors, the ones who pass their genetic inheritance down to the rest of us.<br><br>Why should you care about any of this? Because the final effect of this whole process has been our six GenoTypes, which are extremely useful but very imperfect strategies for survival. Every GenoType has its upside and its downside. I personally can imagine ways to improve every single one of them, and once you get to know them better, I&#x2019;m sure you will, too. In fact, that&#x2019;s the point of this book: What the GenoTypes have begun, we can complete, maximizing their strengths and minimizing their weaknesses through diet, supplements, and exercise. <br><br>Remember, your genes don&#x2019;t stay fixed in their tracks. Instead, they keep reshaping themselves and you, just as they did when you were in the womb. Your cells are constantly reading the environment they&#x2019;re in and altering their functions accordingly: Toxic or safe? Food-rich or barren? Threatening or welcoming? These conditions prompt your cells to turn various genes on and off, depending on how the environment is affecting them. These instructions are implemented at the town meeting, where the volume is turned up on some genes and turned down on others.<br><br>The end result is our six GenoTypes, each of which has its own unique pattern of &#x201c;noisy&#x201d; and &#x201c;silent&#x201d; genes. Accordingly, each of our six GenoType Diets is designed to alter that pattern to promote your optimal health and weight.<br><b><br>Meet the GenoTypes<br></b>So let&#x2019;s take a closer look at these GenoTypes. What possibilities for human survival are encoded within these genetic and prenatal patterns? Before I introduce you to the GenoTypes, I want to caution you against two common mistakes. First, these GenoTypes do not correlate in any way to ethnic patterns. They seem to have developed tens of thousands of years before ethnicity emerged, and with the exception of the Nomad GenoType, which seems to have more than its fair share of redheads, they don&#x2019;t follow any of the statistical patterns that do correlate with ethnicity, skin color, eye color, hair texture, hair color, ancestry information markers, mitochondrial DNA, Y-chromosome DNA, and a host of others with far more technical names. In the end, I could find only a<br>few weak links with some of the ancestral DNA markers but absolutely no correlation with ethnicity&#x2013;none. Just as anyone can be hot-tempered or optimistic, anyone can be any one of these GenoTypes, no matter their racial or ethnic identity or who their ancestors are.

The Germans had a secret transmitter on one of their ships in the neutral harbour of Goa. Its purpose was to guide the U-boats against Allied shipping in the Indian Ocean. There seemed no way for the British to infringe Goa�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s Portuguese neutrality by force. But the transmitter had to be silenced. Then it was remembered that 1,400 miles away in Calcutta was a source of possible help.

It was Dorothy who was responsible for the publication of his first work, when she submitted a short story that he had sent home while on military service. It was initially rejected by Esquire but went on to be published by Story magazine - and so began MacDonald&#39;s writing career. One of the best-loved and most successful of all the masters of hard-boiled crime and suspense, John D. Macdonald was producing brilliant fiction long after many of his contemporaries had been forgotten, and is still highly regarded today. The Executioners, possibly the best known of his non-series novels, was filmed as Cape Fear in 1962 and 1991, but many of the crime thrillers he produced between 1953 and 1964 are considered masterpieces, and he drew praise from such literary greats as Kurt Vonnegut and Stephen King, who declared him to be &#39;the great entertainer of our age, and a mesmerizing storyteller&#39;. His novels are often set in his adopted home of Florida, including those featuring his famous series character Travis McGee, which appeared between 1964 and 1985. He served as president of the Mystery Writers of America and in 1972 was elected a Grand Master, an honour granted only to the greatest crime writers of their generation, including Ross MacDonald, John Le Carre and P. D. James. He won many awards throughout his long career, and was the only mystery writer ever to win the National Book Award, for The Green Ripper.</p><h2>Traditional Logic II Student Workbook, Second Edition</h2><p>A logic course for all ages but designed for use as young as seventh grade, Traditional Logic is an in-depth study of the classical syllogism.

We can trace his influence from Kant in the 1700s to Darwin a century later. <b>The Advancement of Learning</b>, first published in 1605, contains an unprecedented and thorough systematization of the whole range of human knowledge. Bacon&#x2019;s argument that the sciences should move away from divine philosophy and embrace empirical observation would forever change the way philosophers and natural scientists interpret their world.</p><p>While he didn't exactly invent science, Francis Bacon is its best-known early promoter. <i>The Advancement of Learning</i> is his 1605 argument in favor of natural philosophy and inductive reasoning, and it is still vigorous and cogent today. Though using the language of Shakespeare, the book remains largely accessible to modern readers--still, a bit of classical knowledge is helpful. Shaking off the centuries-old domination of Aristotle, Bacon advocated building scientific theories on facts and observations rather than pure reason; little has changed in our approach to understanding the world since then. Of greatest interest to historians and philosophers of science, the book will also appeal to those curious about the underpinnings of today's naturalistic thinking. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>Kessinger Publishing reprints over 1,500 similar titles all available through Amazon.com.</p><h2>Selected Works of H.

Life is marked by change, upheaval and revolution. The authors of this book suggest that, amid this life of turmoil, people are beginning to have conscious and semiconscious experiences of the etheric world of life forces. Yet, this growing sensitivity to the etheric realm only intensifies experiences of movement and upheaval. To counter such feelings, we must take hold of our inner life and strengthen the "I"&#x2015;our true self. <br><br> Featuring essays supplemented with a substantial amount of source material from Rudolf Steiner and other authors, this book introduces us to methods for strengthening one's essential self. In particular, we can learn to practice the ability to add to every physical perception&#x2015;whether of a stone, a plant, an animal or another person&#x2015;of the etheric reality associated with that entity. This process leads us to become more aware of the "after-image." We can also learn to become conscious within the etheric realm. This work with the after-image, says Baruch Urieli, "is not an esoteric path but is, rather, an endeavor to bring the beginnings of a natural consciousness of the etheric to full conciousness and, hence, under the rulership of the ego." <br><br> <i><b>Learning to Experience the Etheric World</b></i> is an invaluable resource for inner development and the beginnings of spiritual sight.</p><p><b>Baruch Luke Urieli</b> is a retired priest of the Christian Community and a long-standing member of the Camphill movement, which has many centers around the world for people with special needs.<br><br><b>Hans M�ller-Wiedemann</b> (1924-1996) studied medicine in T�bingen following his service in World War II.

Some had called it the "ship of death." At least two other Malon export vessels had encountered it, and neither had come out of the experience intact. </p><p> Now it was attacking the <i>Apsac.</i> They'd already been forced to drop out of warp, dangerously close to a star system. Marssi had no idea what had prompted the attack, nor did she care. She just wanted it to stop. </p><p> "Return fire," she snapped, moving from her small circular console in the center of the bridge to Kron's larger one against the starboard bulkhead. </p><p> "We <i>have</i> been," Kron said. "Our weapons have had no effect." </p><p> Marssi rubbed her nostrils. The smell of burning conduits was starting to fill the bridge. "I take it they aren't answering our hails?" </p><p> "Of <i>course</i> not. They don't want to talk, they want to destroy us, same as they do everyone else." Kron turned back to his console. "Shield three is now down. Our weapons banks are almost exhausted and we still haven't even put a dent in their hull. They're coming in for another pass." As he spoke, more weapons fire impacted on the <i>Apsac</i>'s hull. </p><p> Kron spit in anger. His saliva was tinged with green. He motioned as if to wipe hair off his face, which under other circumstances would have made Marssi smile. Kron had been making that gesture during times of stress in all the decades they'd served together, but the old man's gold-brown hair had long since thinned past the possibility of ever actually impeding his vision. </p><p> "Shield four just went down and shield five is at critical levels," he said. "They're on a parabolic course -- they'll be back in weapons range in two minutes." </p><p> Marssi cursed. She had designed the <i>Apsac</i> herself, supervising its entire construction personally. The vessel was groundbreaking -- it had seven separate shields in addition to the reinforced tanks. If that redundancy wasn't enough, the shields were strengthened by an enhancer of her own design. (In truth, designed by someone to whom she'd paid a considerable sum, but as far as she was concerned that made it hers.) Her ship had the lowest incidence of theta-radiation poisoning of any export vessel on Malon Prime and she'd set several records for hauling. Perhaps best of all, her core laborers had a survival rate of sixty percent -- twice that of most other export vessels -- and she was able to pay them well above the already-lucrative going rate. </p><p> Her profit margin was huge -- the cost of constructing the ship and designing the shield enhancer had been recouped by her second run. With this latest trip, she would clear enough to finally buy that house in the mountains that she and Stvoran had had their sights on all these years. </p><p> <i>And now,</i> Marssi thought, <i>these be-damned aliens are going to ruin it.</i> </p><p> From the big console behind her, Gril said, "Controller, look at this." Gril was a new hire -- this was his first run. <i>He's certainly getting more than he signed on for,</i> Marssi thought bitterly. <i>We all are.</i> </p><p> The controller walked over to the young man. "What is it?" </p><p> "We're getting an analysis of their hull -- it's made of monotanium! Can you imagine that? No wonder our weapons have had no effect. If we could make our ships out of that -- " </p><p> Rolling his eyes, Kron said, "Do you know how much it'd cost to mass-produce enough monotanium to build a tanker, Gril?" </p><p> "I know, I know, but think of it! We'd never have another tank rupture." </p><p> "We've never had one in the first place, you idiot," Kron muttered. </p><p> Defensively, Gril said, "You know what I mean." </p><p> Marssi looked more closely at the readouts as they scrolled across Gril's black screen in clear green letters. In addition to the powerful hull, the small, squat ship had a very efficient dicyclic warp signature, decades ahead of anything the Malons had developed for faster-than-light travel. </p><p> "You're right, Gril," she said. "Those aliens do know how to build a ship." </p><p> An alarm sounded. Marssi heard the staccato rhythm of Kron's boots on the bulkhead as he ran to one of the other consoles. She turned to see that he seemed a bit blurry -- a green haze was starting to descend upon the bridge. <i>One of those burning conduits must be leaking</i> arvat. <i>That's just what we need.</i> </p><p> Kron pushed a few buttons and then pounded the console with his fist. "Dammit! The warp core containment field is showing signs of collapse and the impulse drive is down." He turned to look at Marssi, his yellow eyes smoldering with anger, his golden skin tinged with sweat. "We can't even move now. And they'll be in range in one minute." </p><p> <i>Wonderful,</i> Marssi thought. <i>If the tanks don't rupture and the shields don't go down, we could still die from a containment breach.</i> </p><p> "Who are these people, anyhow?" Gril asked as he nervously scratched his left nostril. "What do they want with us?" </p><p> "The Hirogen are hunters," Marssi said grimly, walking back to her center console and running a check to see if she could get the propulsion systems back online. "No one knows where they come from, but they've shown up in every part of known space. Supposedly, they'll hunt anything and everything. This particular ship has been reported in this sector at least twice." </p><p> "From what I hear," Kron said with a nasty look at Gril as he moved back across the bridge to his own console, "there's only one way to survive an encounter with them: don't be their prey." </p><p> "But -- but we <i>are</i> their prey." </p><p> "Smart boy," Kron said with a grim smile, then glanced at a readout. "That's interesting, they've slowed down. They're still closing, but it'll be another minute or two before they're in range." He snorted. "They probably realize that we can't fight back, so they're going to take their time with us now." </p><p> Gril shook his head. "I don't get it. Why hunt <i>us?"</i> </p><p> "It's what they <i>do,"</i> Kron snapped. </p><p> "Yeah, but whatever they do to us will kill them, too, if the tanks rupture or the core breaches. What's the good of being a hunter if you don't live to enjoy the fruits of the hunt?" </p><p> Marssi turned to Gril. "That's a good point. Maybe he just doesn't know." She looked at Kron. "Open a channel to them." </p><p> Kron snorted. "They haven't answered a single hail yet." </p><p> "They don't have to answer, they just have to listen. Open the channel." </p><p> Scowling, Kron pushed three buttons in sequence. "Fine, it's open." </p><p> Marssi took a deep breath -- then regretted it, as the burning-conduit smell had gotten worse. "Attention Hirogen ship. If you continue with your present course of action, this ship will be destroyed and our cargo will be exposed to space. We are currently carrying over half a trillion isotons of antimatter waste. We have heard stories of how Hirogen hunters can weather anything, but I doubt that even you could survive being exposed to those levels of theta radiation. Over half our shields are down and a warp core containment breach is imminent. There's a danger of physical damage to the tankers as well. Any one of these can lead to this entire star system being irradiated and will result in the instant death of you, us, and anyone else in the immediate vicinity. Please, break off your attack -- for your own sake, if not for ours." </p><p> Kron's eyes went wide. "They're replying." </p><p> "You sound surprised," Marssi said dryly. </p><p> "That's because I am," Kron said, shooting her a look. "On screen." </p><p> A face appeared on the console in front of Marssi. The creature fit the descriptions from the stories she'd heard of the Hirogen: a face of rough, mottled skin, with the rest of the body covered in metallic, faceted body armor. The helmet had four ridges that began close together at the forehead and spread out and around to the back of the head. This one also had a streak of white paint on either side of each middle ridge. As he spoke, he reached up to his forehead with a gloved hand. Red paint dripped from the index finger, and the Hirogen applied it to the section of the helmet under the leftmost ridge. </p><p> <i>"Prey. You will surrender."</i> </p><p> The screen went blank before Marssi could say anything in reply. </p><p> "Either they're immune to theta radiation, or they don't believe you," Kron said. "Or maybe they just don't care." </p><p> Again, Marssi cursed. "Any luck getting the propulsion systems back up?" </p><p> "No. The Hirogen ship's velocity is still pretty leisurely. Rumor has it they like to deal with their prey one on one. My guess is that they're going to try to board us." </p><p> Since the Hirogen ship was only a fraction of the size of the tanker, this seemed reasonable to Marssi. <i>There is no way I'm going to surrender to that monster. I've heard about what they do to people they capture -- weird experiments, dissections, and worse.</i> </p><p> So, even if they surrendered, they were going to die. </p><p> <i>If that's the way it's going to be, fine. They told me a woman could never be a controller. They told me the</i> Apsac <i>would never work right. I didn't let that stop me then, and I damn well won't let it stop me now.</i> </p><p> She looked at the image of the Hirogen ship on her screen. <i>And if I don't, at least I'll have the satisfaction of knowing you'll die too, you waste-sucking toad.</i> </p><p> Kron announced, "They're firing again," and the <i>Apsac</i> lurched. "That did it. Shields five and six are both down and seven is buckling. One more shot, and we've got serious problems." </p><p> "Yes, Kron," Marssi muttered, shaking her head, "our problems until now have been quite droll." </p><p> "Controller, I'm picking up something!" Gril cried before Kron had a chance to reply. "Something just appeared a hundred and fifty <i>hentas</i> off the nose!" </p><p> "I'm picking it up, too," Kron said, much more calmly. "It's -- a hole." </p><p> Marssi blinked. "I beg your pardon?" </p><p> "A hole." </p><p> "Can you be a <i>little</i> more specific, Kron?" </p><p> "No," Kron snapped. "That's the only way I can describe this. It's an opening of some kind, and based on the readings I'm getting -- huh. There are stars and planets and such on the other side, but it's not matching anything on our star charts." </p><p> Another impact. Gril said, "Shield seven will go on the next shot!" </p><p> "So it's a wormhole," Marssi said to Kron. </p><p> Kron shook his head. "No, it's completely stable, and it doesn't have any of the properties of a wormhole. In fact, it doesn't have the properties of much of anything. I'm not picking up any particulate matter that wasn't there before, no changes in the chemical composition of the area around it. It's just -- a hole." He looked over at Marssi, and the controller was amazed at the look of disbelief on her old comrade's face. "It's like it's some kind of -- of gateway to another star system." </p><p> "What the <i>tuul</i> is it doing here?" Gril asked. </p><p> "Who the <i>tuul</i> cares?" Marssi said with a grim smile. <i>Maybe I will see Stvoran and Ella again.</i> "Kron, use maneuvering thrusters -- I want the <i>Apsac</i> positioned so that the openings to the tanks are facing that hole." </p><p> Kron returned her smile, though his was less grim for a change. "Consider it done. Thrusters online." </p><p> Marssi nodded. She remembered one controller who had once been the most profligate of those who disposed of Malon's industrial waste. He had found, in essence, a hole to dump the waste into -- a hole located in a starless region known simply as the Void. Unfortunately, another ship full of irritating aliens -- the <i>Voyager</i> -- had forced him to stop by cutting off his access to the Void. Marssi hadn't minded, as that opened the field a bit -- his success was in danger of putting several controllers out of business -- and it gave her the opportunity to secure the funds to build the <i>Apsac</i>. </p><p> Now she'd found her own version of that Void. </p><p> "Preparing to eject the tanks," Gril said. </p><p> "No," Marssi snapped, whirling on the young man. "We're just ejecting the contents into the hole." </p><p> Gril blinked. "But -- but Controller, that'll expose the waste! The radiation -- " </p><p> "We'll only be exposed for a short time, not enough to have any lasting effect. I'm not losing the tanks down that hole as well. Unless, of course, you want to replace them out of your earnings?" </p><p> "N-no," Grill said quietly, and turned back to his console. </p><p> "That may be academic," Kron said. "Shield seven just went down and the Hirogen is at four hentas and closing." </p><p> "Maybe. But even if we die, I want it to be just us who do. I won't let Stvoran and Ella live with the disgrace of being the husband and daughter of the woman who destroyed a star system." </p><p> "Very considerate," Kron said dryly. "We're in position now." </p><p> "Begin ejecting the waste." </p><p> Marssi stood at her console and saw the external camera's image of the green-tinged toxic material start to jet its way into the vacuum of space. </p><p> <i>Soon enough it'll be in the hole and someone else's problem. My problem is the Hirogen. Once we no longer have to worry about the tanks rupturing, maybe we'll have a better chance against them.</i> </p><p> Right on cue, the Hirogen ship came into view. </p><p> An errant cluster of waste material tumbled right toward it. It collided with the hunter's small vessel with sufficient impact that even a monotanium hull couldn't save it. </p><p> Like all explosions in space, it was brief, but no less spectacular for all that. It blossomed evenly, then contracted into nothingness -- aside from the green mass that had caused the explosion, which continued to tumble toward the hole. </p><p> To Controller Marssi, it was the most beautiful sight she'd seen since the completed <i>Apsac</i> was first unveiled on Malon Prime. </p><p> She still had no idea what that hole was or where it came from, and right now she didn't care. All she knew was that if it hadn't shown up when it did, she never would have ejected her payload, and the Hirogen ship would still be in one piece. </p><p> "Looks like you beat the odds again, Controller," Kron said with a smile, his words mirroring Marssi's own thoughts. </p><p> Laughing, Marssi said, "Did you ever doubt it?" </p><p> "Yes, every second. But, like all the other times you've proved me wrong, I'm glad you've done so." </p><p> "Controller," Gril said, his voice shaking, "I must protest this! We don't know what's on the other side of that hole! What if -- " </p><p> Marssi knew exactly what Gril was going to say, and so was happy to interrupt him. "Gril, what is the mission statement of this vessel?" </p><p> "To -- to dispose of the waste that accrues from our use of antimatter in a manner that will not be harmful to the Malon community as a whole," he said as if reciting from a textbook -- <i>probably,</i> Marssi thought, recalling Gril's age, <i>read recently.</i> </p><p> "Exactly," she said, advancing slowly on...</p></p><h2>The Baker Illustrated Guide to the Bible: A Book-by-Book Companion</h2><p><b>A Clear and Reliable Guide to Each Book of the Bible<br></b><br><i>The Baker Illustrated Guide to the Bible </i>provides a clear, reliable, and attractive resource to enhance personal Bible study.

His five previous Shan novels, The Skull Mantra (St Martins 1999), Water Touching Stone (2001), Bone Mountain (2002), Beautiful Ghosts (2004), and Prayer of the Dragon (2007), have been critical and commercial successes. He won the Edgar for Best First Novel and was nominated for the CWA Golden Dagger.The discovery of two mutilated corpses and a comatose stranger on the ancient pilgrims' path up Tibet's Sleeping Dragon mountain throws former Beijing special investigator Shan into a quandary at the start of Edgar-winner Pattison's atmospheric fifth mystery set in Tibet (after 2005's <i>Beautiful Ghosts</i>). The detective and gulag escapee, who has been mysteriously summoned to the remote hamlet of Drango along with his lama friends Lokesh and Gendun, refuses to let the survivor be summarily executed for murder, putting himself and the equally outlaw monks in jeopardy. Shan soon finds himself with just days to delve into a deepening conundrum that hints at both modern corruption and ancient evil. Pattison fans will savor all the Tibetan flavor they have come to expect as well as an intriguing subplot exploring possible kinship between Tibetans and the Navajo. (Tony Hillerman buffs, take note.) Although first-timers may initially stumble over the abundance of foreign names, the journey, like the climb up Sleeping Dragon, soon becomes both frightening and unforgettable. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Even Titus and other Roman emporors respected the ancient prophet. Daniel&#39;s view of &#34;the times of the Gentiles&#34; has thus far been fulfilled with uncanny accuracy. Beyond his writing about the four kingdoms and the cutting off of the Messiah, Daniel focused on the roots and works of the future Antichrist. No other Old Testament prophet spent as many chapters on the &#34;little horn&#34; as Daniel. In fact, when John penned the Apocalypse, most of his metaphors, the beast, three and a half years timing, God&#39;s throne, etc. alluded to Daniel&#39;s visions. The prophecy of the &#34;seventy weeks&#34; has perplexed theologians for centuries. Many have tried to figure out the timing, but with little success. However, in this volume, you will discover that Daniel&#39;s &#34;weeks&#34; were fulfilled in concert with the Sabbatical cycles, as given in the Mosaic Law. Problems with the dating occured because 2nd century rabbis removed 243 years from their calendar in order to cause Daniel&#39;s prophecy to line up with Rabbi Akiva&#39;s declaration that Bar Kokhba was the promised &#34;star&#34; out of Jacob. You will find that this book fills in the historical gaps and lays out the calendar of events in an easy-to-understand format. 330 page paperback.</p><p></p><h2>The Iron Cage: The Story of the Palestinian Struggle for Statehood</h2><p>In <i>Resurrecting Empire,</i> Rashid Khalidi dissected the failures of colonial policy over the entire span of the modern history of the Middle East, predicted the meltdown in Iraq that we are now witnessing with increasing horror, and offered viable alternatives for achieving peace in the region. His newest book, <i>The Iron Cage,</i> hones in on Palestinian politics and history. Once again Khalidi draws on a wealth of experience and scholarship to elucidate the current conflict, using history to provide a clear-eyed view of the situation today.<br><br>The story of the Palestinian search to establish a state begins in the era of British control over Palestine and stretches between the two world wars, when colonial control of the region became increasingly unpopular and power began to shift toward the United States. In this crucial period, and in the years immediately following World War II, Palestinian leaders were unable to achieve the long-cherished goal of establishing an independent state-a critical failure that throws a bright light on the efforts of the Palestinians to create a state in the many decades since 1948. By frankly discussing the reasons behind this failure, Khalidi offers a much-needed perspective for anyone concerned about peace in the Middle East.</p><p>Rashid Khalidi, author of six books about the Middle East&#x2014;Sowing Crisis, The Iron Cage, Resurrecting Empire, Origins of Arab Nationalism, Under Siege, and the award-winning Palestinian Identity&#x2014;is the Edward Said Chair in Arab Studies and director of the Middle East Institute at Columbia University. He has written more than eighty articles on Middle Eastern history and politics, including pieces in the New York Times, the Boston Globe, the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, and many journals. Professor Khalidi has received fellowships and grants from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the American Research Center in Egypt, and the Rockefeller Foundation; he was also the recipient of a Fulbright research award. Professor Khalidi has been a regular guest on numerous radio and TV shows, including All Things Considered, Talk of the Nation, Morning Edition, NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, and Nightline.Historian Khalidi <i>(Resurrecting Empire)</i>, a leading expert on the Middle East and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, brings vital perspective to Palestinian attempts to achieve independence and statehood. Admirably synthesizing the latest scholarship and concentrating on the period of the British Mandate (1920&#x2013;1948) established by the League of Nations after WWI, Khalidi describes the process by which a newly arrived European Jewish minority overcame, with help from its imperial ally, the claims and rights of the native Arab majority in what became Israel and the occupied territories. Khalidi shows Palestinians under the mandate facing comparatively severe systemic, institutional and constitutional obstacles to the development of any para-state structure&#x2014;contrary to British promises of Arab independence and Article 4 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. Meanwhile, the Jewish minority could count on a system biased in its favor to develop the structures that became those of the Israeli government in 1948 amid violent expulsion of over half the indigenous population. In bringing this narrative up to the present, Khalidi rigorously details the missteps of the Palestinians and their leadership. Khalidi curiously refrains from drawing any detailed proposal of his own to resolve the ongoing conflict, but his first-rate and up-to-date historical and political analysis of the Palestinian predicament remains illuminating. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Readers are introduced to privateers, buccaneers, and corsairs, and told how they differ. Illustrations of various types of pirate ships, and the merchant vessels that were most often their targets, are particularly effective. Unfortunately, maps are few and far between and those included are too small and poorly labeled to be of much use. Building contains all of the virtues of other "Eyewitness" books, but is hampered by trying to cover too much territory. The history of building techniques, materials, and philosophy from earth-and-thatch houses to cathedrals and skyscrapers is crammed into the 64-page format.

The Way of Four helps you determine which of the four elements are prominent and which are lacking in your world using a variety of custom-made quizzes. It includes a multitude of methods to incorporate and balance the elements in your environment, wardrobe, and even your perfume. This is a fun and valuable sourcebook for anyone seeking balance and beauty in a hectic world.</p></p><p><p><strong>Deborah Lipp</strong> (Jersey City, NJ) has been teaching Wicca, magic, and the occult for over 30 years. She became a Gardnerian witch and high priestess in the 1980s, and she's been published in many Pagan publications, including <em>newWitch</em>, <em>Llewellyn's Magical Almanac</em>, <em>Pangaia</em>, and <em>Green Egg.</em> Deborah has lectured on Pagan and occult topics on three continents and has appeared in various media discussing Wicca, including <em>Coast-to-Coast</em> radio, an A&amp;E documentary (A<em>ncient Mysteries: Witchcraft in America</em>), television talk shows, and the <em>New York Times</em>. She is the author of several books, including <em>Magical Power for Beginners</em>. Follow her on Twitter: @DebLippAuthor</p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>The Way of Four grew out of my deep conviction that every occult education begins with the four elements, and no occultist worth her salt fails to make use of elemental lore. Everything we do, everything we study, and everything we systematize comes from Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. The Kabbalah is more vastly inclusive, the Tarot more personal, and the Zodiac more universal, but all of them ultimately come down to four.</p> <p>In my years of teaching Pagan and Wiccan groups, I invariably put a class on the four elements at the beginning of the syllabus. On nights when I was too tired, stressed, or overworked to come up with new class material, I sometimes used a review of the elements as the evening's material. Such reviews were always fresh, lively, and informative.</p> <p>The Way itself is the way of balance. Wicca and Paganism are all about balance, about moderation, about plurality. We are neither austere nor hedonistic, neither cynical nor credulous, neither irreverent nor somber. When we practice Paganism successfully, we walk in balance. To do so, we must know ourselves well and be brave enough to face the changes we might need to make. The process of self-actualization is vital to a spiritual life. <em>The Way of Four </em>comes from my understanding of balancing self within the context of nature and reality.</p> <p>Exercises in this book run the full gamut. Some are meditations done privately, at home, but others take place by interacting with nature. Many are serious and even involve hard work, but others are fun and playful. The Way of Four is a way that encompasses all of life, including things that seem frivolous. Whether you are meditating in an incense-filled temple or redecorating your living room, the Way of Four can come into play.</p> <p>This book is also interspersed with quizzes, checklists, and worksheets. It's important that you make the book <em>yours</em>, that you participate completely in the processes laid out. Things may turn out differently than the way I've described them. You, as an individual, are the only one who can finally determine how the elements balance in <em>your </em>life. That's why the book is designed around your personal self-discovery process. I ask more questions than I answer so that you can find the answers in yourself. I hope you find the process as rich and rewarding as I do.</p></p><h2>Mildred Pierced: A Toby Peters Mystery</h2><p>That down-at-the-heels gumshoe Toby Peters again proves to be &#x201c;an unblemished delight,&#x201d; as the Washington Post Book World put it, while his creator, Stuart M. Kaminsky, continues to &#x201c;make the totally wacky possible&#x201d; in a zany new Hollywood adventure. Having survived the hire of such movie luminaries as Humphrey Bogart, Bette Davis, Charlie Chaplin, and Cary Grant, tinsel-town detective Toby finds himself in the employ of an edgy Joan Crawford. Actually, Toby needs Miss Crawford as much as she needs him. His longtime friend and office mate, the mad dentist Sheldon Minck, has been jailed for murder&#x2014;the victim, his estranged wife, Mildred; the motive, a $200,000 inheritance; the weapon, a crossbow. Only Miss Crawford, the single witness to the crime, can attest to hapless Minck&#x2019;s innocence. But the former MGM movie queen has just been offered her first film in two years, as the title character in Mildred Pierce, so she is anxious to avoid unpleasant publicity that could cost her the role. So it&#x2019;s up to Toby to solve the crime, save Minck, and thus keep Miss Crawford&#x2019;s famous name out of the daily papers.</p><p><p>Stuart M. Kaminsky (1934-2009) was one of the most prolific crime fiction authors of the last four decades. Born in Chicago, Kaminsky penned more than sixty novels over his lifetime. In 1981's Death of a Dissident, Kaminsky debuted Moscow police detective Porfiry Rostnikov, whose stories were praised for their accurate depiction of Soviet life. He died in St. Louis in 2009.</p>*Starred Review* A woman named Mildred is pierced by a bolt from a crossbow in a public park; Joan Crawford, out on an errand before she begins filming <i>Mildred Pierce,</i> witnesses the killing. So, Kaminski's punny title for the twenty-third Toby Peters mystery perfectly captures the ridiculous (in the best sense of the term) cross-cutting between detection and movie lore that has long been the hallmark of this series. Peters' career as an ex-cop-current private eye spans a fascinating chunk of Hollywood movie history, from the Depression--<i>Murder on the Yellow Brick Road</i> (1977), in which Peters took on the case of an allegedly murderous Munchkin--into World War II. Now, it's June 1944. Toby is still figuring out the ration points for his boardinghouse landlady and renting office space from the dentist Sheldon Minck. It's Minck who's in trouble, big time, because he admits shooting the crossbow that killed his wife but insists it was another of his many klutzy accidents. Peters is working for both Minck, who hires him to help prove his innocence, and Joan Crawford, who hires him to keep her name out of the papers. As Peters investigates, he is pulled into a bizarre world of survivalists who want Minck dead and, once again, into the bizarre world of Hollywood infighting. Kaminsky stands out as a subtle historian, unobtrusively but entertainingly weaving into the story itself what people were wearing, eating, driving, and listening to on the radio. A page-turning romp. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I don&#x2019;t know what I want or how to get it. Iact like I know what I want, and I appear to be going after it&#x2014;fast,but I don&#x2019;t, when it comes down to it, even know. I guess it&#x2019;s becauseI&#x2019;m afraid. Afraid I&#x2019;m wrong. And I guess I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;mwrong, because I constantly relate myself to other people, otherexperiences, other ideas. I should be looking at both in perspective,not comparing. I relate my life to an idea or an example thatis some entirely different life. I should be relating it to my life onlyin the sense that each has good and bad facets. Each is separate.The only way the other attained enough merit, making it worthyof my admiration, or long to copy it is by taking chances, taking itin its own way. It has grown with different situations and has discovereddifferent heights of happiness and equal sorrows.

He describes the means which have been adopted to satisfy the three functions of clothes: protection, expression of the personality by sartorial display, and attractiveness to others. The momentous invention of the needle (some 40,000 years ago), making possible the sewing together of pelts, and the subsequent introduction of weaving, launched the development of costume as we know it. All the major historical landmarks -- the Renaissance, the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, the emancipation of women, the two world wars -- wrought profound changes in attitudes to dress: with matchless skill and panache Laver related the development of costume and fashion to these social changes. A new final chapter by Christina Probert brings the history up to the present day [sic] with a detailed discussion of the enormous variety of postwar styles, including the New Look, the mini, and punk-influenced clothes. James Laver (1899-1975) was keeper of the Departments of Prints and Drawings and of Paintings at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, from 1938 until 1959. He was also an important and pioneering fashion historian described as &#x201c;the man in England who made the study of costume respectable&#x201d;. Laver is perhaps best remembered for his contributions to the field of fashion history, an interest in which emerged through a desire to date images accurately through the clothing depicted within. Laver defined the relationships between dress design and other applied arts, and discussed the influence of economic and social factors upon the development of fashionable taste.</p><p><p>The late <strong>James Laver</strong> was Keeper of the Departments of Prints and Drawings and of Paintings at the Victoria and Albert Museum from 1938 until 1959.</p><p><strong>Amy de la Haye</strong> is an expert dress historian.

There is no other choice. I choose life."</i><br><br>James H. Cone is widely recognized as the founder of Black Liberation Theology-- a synthesis of the Gospel message embodied by Martin Luther King, Jr., and the spirit of Black pride embodied by Malcolm X. Prompted by the Detroit riots and the death of King, Cone, a young theology professor, was impelled to write his first book, <i>Black Theology and Black Power,</i> followed by <i>A Black Theology of Liberation.</i> With these works he established himself as one of the most prophetic and challenging voices of our time.<br><br>In this powerful and passionate memoir-- his final work-- Cone describes the obstacles he overcame to find his voice, to respond to the signs of the times, and to offer a voice for those-- like the parents who raised him in Bearden, Arkansas in the era of lynching and Jim Crow-- who had no voice. Recounting lessons learned both from critics and students, and the ongoing challenge of his models King, Malcolm X, and James Baldwin, he describes his efforts to use theology as a tool in the struggle against oppression and for a better world.</p><p><b>James H. Cone</b> (1938-2018) was the Bill and Judith Moyers Distinguished Professor of Systematic Theology at Union Theological Seminary. His books include <i>A Black Theology of Liberation, Martin &amp; Malcolm &amp; America: A Dream or a Nightmare,</i> and <i>The Cross and the Lynching Tree,</i> winner of the 2018 Grawemeyer Award in Religion. This year he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.<i>"In this memoir, James Hal Cone--that most private of theologians--shares with us the story of a soul forged in a loving home, formed in the faith of Macedonia AME Church, 'disturbed by blackness,' tested by adversity, sensitized by human suffering, poured out in teaching and in writing. His life and work continue to push us, rouse us, inspire us to integrity in thought, speech, and action in authentic achievement of beloved community. We praise God that James Cone testified what the Lord did for him!"</i> --<b>M. Shawn Copeland,</b> Boston College, and co-author of <i>Uncommon Faithfulness: The Black Catholic Experience.</i><br><br><i>"Cone's autobiography is extremely readable, written in his clear and precise prose. Like the man himself, there is not an ounce of rhetorical fat. And while there are glimpses of Bearden, Arkansas, and Macedonia AME Church, the formidable spaces which shaped the younger Cone, this autobiography considers the James Cone of Union Theological Seminary fame.</i> Said I Wasn't Gonna Tell Nobody <i>is the story of James Cone, the scholar; a man aware of his rightful place in the canon of American theology. Cone dedicates his memoir to the 'students and faculty of Union Theological Seminary, who challenged and inspired' him for nearly half a century. It is the story of how, as Cone writes, 'black theology found me and gave me voice.'"</i> --<b>Yolanda Pierce, in <i>Religion and Politics</i></b><br><br><i>"If there was ever a time we needed James Cone with his powerful prophetic voice to call down thunder, that time is now.... </i>Said I Wasn't Gonna Tell Nobody<i> testifies to a message that we sorely need. If we fail to listen to Cone and allow his words to live in our hearts and our actions, we fall short of our Christian vocation to love our neighbors and to liberate the captives, the marginalized, and the oppressed."</i> --<b><i>Christian Century</i></b></p><h2>Quest for the Queen (Secrets of Droon #10)</h2><p>Eric, Neal, and Julie return to Droon to help Princess Keeah win a contest in which she can use no magic, but for which her prize will be what she most desires--a cure for the spell that causes her mother, Queen Relna, to change into different kinds of animal.Eric, Neal, and Julie help Princess Keeah win a contest in which she can use no magic, but for which her prize will be what she most desires--a cure for the spell that causes her mother to change into different kinds of animal.</p><p><p>TONY ABBOTT is the author of more than fifty novels for young readers, including more than thirty books in <em>The Secrets of Droon </em>series and two hardcover novels, <em>Kringle</em> and <em>Firegirl</em>.

Now this acclaimed author gives us his most beguiling novel yet--a magical tale of love, betrayal, and redemption inspired by Shakespeare's <em>The Tempest</em>. <p> On wealthy Plantation Island in South Florida, an old man waits, Kenzie Maxwell is a writer, a raconteur, a rascal, an altruist, a mystic--a charismatic figure who enjoys life with his rich third wife but muses daily on the sins of his past. Two decades ago, Kenzie had to leave New York because of a scandal. He'd been a volunteer at a runawat shelter, and he'd fallen in love with a seventeen-year-old girl--a girl who died while giving birth to Kenzie's daughter. His older brother, Dalton, a lawyer and board member at the shelter, decided to quell the rumors by releasing Kenzie's note of apology to the press. Kenzie's reputation--and the girl's--were destroyed. He has never forgiven his brother. </p><p> Now it's the eve of Kenzie's seventieth birthday, and a storm is brewing. His beloved daughter, Bree--the child of the scandal--is coming down from New York for his birthday party. But his brother Dalton is coming down, too, to do some legal work for the island's ill-tempered matriarch. Aided and abetted by Dalton's happy-go-lucky stepson, a loutish gardener, a New Age windsurfer, a bumbling bishop, and a bona fide tempest, Kenzie must somehow contrive to reconcile with his brother--and make peace with his past. </p><p> Infused with humanity, and informed by faith. <em>The Storm</em> is Frederick Buechner's most captivating novel since <em>Godric</em>--a richly satisfying contemporary story of fragmented families and love's many mysteries that will move you, make you laugh, and fill you with wonder.</p></p><p>An island. A storm. A shipwreck. An exiled old man with a beautiful daughter--sound familiar? If <i>The Tempest</i> comes to mind, you're close. Frederick Buechner bases his novel <i>The Storm</i> on Shakespeare's melancholy last play, but adds some distinctly 20th-century twists of his own. The protagonist of this tall tale is Kenzie Maxwell, an elderly writer living off his third wife's money on an island in South Florida. Kenzie's 70th birthday is coming up, and his family starts to gather: his illegitimate daughter, Bree, comes from New York; and so does his estranged brother, Dalton--the man responsible for his leaving New York in disgrace many years before. Also along for the ride is Dalton's appealing young stepson, Nandy; Kenzie's mystical wind-surfer pal, Averill; and Calvert, the boorish gardener. Readers familiar with the play will instantly recognize who's who in this gallery of characters. Though the party gets off to a rocky start and a tempest is brewing just off shore, by the time Buechner finishes working his own rough magic, <i>The Storm</i> becomes a harbinger not of disaster but of reconciliation and love. <i>--Margaret Prior</i><p>Frederick Buechner, author of more than thirty works of fiction and nonfiction, is an ordained Presbyterian minister.

Yet, few leaders devote focused attention to how this design is chosen, implemented, and adjusted over time. Robert Simons argues that by viewing design as a powerful and proactive management lever--rather than an inevitable outcome of corporate evolution--leaders can maximize productivity across every level of the organization. Levers of Organization Design presents a new design theory based on four key yet often underrated categories: customer definition, critical performance variables, creative tension, and commitment to mission. Building from these core areas, Simons lays out a step-by-step process leaders can follow to create structures and accountability systems that positively influence how people do their work, where they focus their attention, and how their activities can be aligned to contribute to overall strategic goals. He also introduces four levers of organizational design--unit configuration, diagnostic control systems, interactive networks, and responsibility to others--that leaders can manipulate to improve overall organizational efficiency and effectiveness vastly. For anyone accountable for measuring and managing performance, this book shows how good design can become an organization's roadmap to success. Robert Simons is the Charles M.

More than 50 NHL players, coaches, and media personalities were interviewed to examine how players go about their business during a fight on the ice. They explain why fighting is allowed and what tactics are used before, during, and after the melees. <i>The Code: The Unwritten Rules of Fighting and Retaliation in the NHL</i> discusses the top reasons why the gloves come off during hockey games.</p></p><p>Hockey is and always has been a sport steeped in a culture of violence. Players have learned, however, to navigate the escalating levels of physical contact by adhering to an honor system known simply as "the Code." As mysterious as it is sacred, the Code is an unwritten set of rules&#x2014;the bible of hockey sportsmanship, if you will&#x2014;that has been handed down from generation to generation. Although the Code has been around since the game&#x2019;s inception in Canada, it remains a taboo subject, so much so that many players are simply unwilling to talk about it publicly&#x2014;until now, that is. <p>Author Ross Bernstein spent two years researching and conducting extensive interviews with a broad spectrum of players, and he was able to get them to talk freely about their most intimate feelings about fighting and retaliation. What he learned and shares in this book is truly fascinating. While some players relished opportunities to drop the gloves and others simply dreaded it, they all had one thing in common: they did it when they had to in order to protect themselves as well as their teammates. The Code features extensive quotes that detail everything from the legal and cultural issues between the North American players and their foreign counterparts to how the players are able to turn it off when they leave the arena and go home to their kids. Most importantly, this book reveals what really goes on between the players while the fights are on. </p><p>Hockey&#x2019;s rules of engagement can be summarized in three categories: protection, intimidation, and retaliation. If one player challenges another player, that second player must answer the call and "show up" or else face the humiliation of being considered dirty, or even a coward. Worse yet, if that player refuses to right what was wronged and defend his actions, he risks having that incident escalate to a higher level, involving additional teammates. That is when the enforcers come off the bench to keep the peace, and that is also usually when the crowd goes wild. By the time two heavyweights drop the gloves, there may have been up to a dozen events between several different players that led up to that fight. That is all a part of the intricate matrix that makes up the Code. And this book will help to demystify that matrix for you. </p><p>The Code is completely up to date with the new league-wide rules changes, which were implemented following the NHL lockout of 2005, when the rules of engagement completely changed. This first-of-its-kind project provides an incredible window into an extremely controversial subject matter that always evokes passion. It&#x2019;s a must-read for all puckheads!</p><p><b>Ross Bernstein</b> is the bestselling author of 40 sports books and has appeared on numerous local and national television and radio programs.

Had he lived amidst Gothic darkness and barbarity, where no records were used, and letters altogether unknown, we might have expected to derive from tradition, a number of particulars relating to the family and fortune of a man so remarkably admired even in his own time. But, one would imagine pains had been taken to throw a veil of oblivion over the personal concerns of this excellent author. No inquiry hath, as yet, been able to ascertain the place of his nativity;1 and, although in his works he has declared himself a gentleman by birth, no house has hitherto laid claim to such an illustrious descendant.<br><br>One author* says he was born at Esquivias; but, offers no argument in support of his assertion: and probably the conjecture was founded upon the encomiums which Cervantes himself bestows on that place, to which he gives the epithet of Renowned, in his preface to Persiles and Sigismunda.2 Others affirm he first drew breath in Lucena, grounding their opinion upon a vague tradition which there prevails: and a third* set take it for granted that he was a native of Seville, because there are families in that city known by the names of Cervantes and Saavedra; and our author mentions his having, in his early youth, seen plays acted by Lope Rueda, who was a Sevilian. These, indeed, are presumptions that deserve some regard, tho', far from implying certain information, they scarce even amount to probable conjecture: nay, these very circumstances seem to disprove the supposition; for, had he been actually descended from those families, they would, in all likelihood, have preserved some memorials of his birth, which Don Nicholas Antonio would have recorded, in speaking of his fellow-citizen. All these pretensions are now generally set aside in favour of Madrid, which claims the honour of having produced Cervantes, and builds her title on an expression? in his Voyage to Parnassus, which, in my opinion, is altogether equivocal and inconclusive.<br><br>In the midst of such undecided contention, if I may be allowed to hazard a conjecture, I would suppose that there was something mysterious in his extraction, which he had no inclination to explain, and that his family had domestic reasons for maintaining the like reserve. Without admitting some such motive, we can hardly account for his silence on a subject that would have afforded him an opportunity to indulge that self-respect which he so honestly displays in the course of his writings. Unless we conclude that he was instigated to renounce all connexion with his kindred and allies, by some contempt'ous flight, mortifying repulse, or real injury he had sustained; a supposition which, I own, is not at all improbable, considering the jealous sensibility of the Spaniards in general, and the warmth of resentment peculiar to our author, which glows through his productions, unrestrained by all the fears of poverty, and all the maxims of old age and experience.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Heir To The Glimmering World</h2><p>Cynthia Ozick is an American master at the height of her powers in <i>Heir to the Glimmering World</i>, a grand romantic novel of desire, fame, fanaticism, and unimaginable reversals of fortune.

Rosie, orphaned at eighteen, has been living with her distant relative Bertram, who sparks her first erotic desires. But just as he begins to return her affection, his lover, a radical socialist named Ninel (Lenin spelled backward), turns her out.<br><br> And so Rosie takes refuge from love among refugees of world upheaval. Cast out from Berlin&#x2019;s elite, the Mitwissers live at the whim of a mysterious benefactor, James A'Bair. Professor Mitwisser is a terrifying figure, obsessed with his arcane research. His distraught wife, Elsa, once a prominent physicist, is becoming unhinged. Their willful sixteen-year-old daughter runs the household: the exquisite, enigmatic Anneliese. Rosie's place here is uncertain, and she finds her fate hanging on the arrival of James. Inspired by the real Christopher Robin, James is the Bear Boy, the son of a famous children's author who recreated James as the fanciful subject of his books. Also a kind of refugee, James runs from his own fame, a boy adored by the world but grown into a bitter man. It is Anneliese&#x2019;s fierce longing that draws James back to this troubled house, and it is Rosie who must help them all resist James&#x2019;s reckless orbit.<br><br> Ozick lovingly evokes these perpetual outsiders thrown together by surprising chance.

She lives in New York.Chapter 1<br><br>In 1935, when I was just eighteen, I entered the household of Rudolf Mitwisser, the scholar of Karaism. The scholar of Karaism&#x201d; at that time I had no idea what that meant, or why it should be the&#x201d; instead of a,&#x201d; or who Rudolf Mitwisser was. I understood only that he was the father of what seemed to be numerous children, and that he had come from Germany two years before. I knew these things from an advertisement in the Albany Star:<br><br>Professor, arrived 1933 Berlin, children 3 14, requires assistant, relocate NYC. Respond Mitwisser, 22 Westerley.<br><br>It read like a telegram; Professor Mitwisser, I would soon learn, was parsimonious. The ad did not mention Elsa, his wife. Possibly he had forgotten about her.<br><br>In my letter of reply I said that I would be willing to go to New York, though it was not clear from the notice in the Star what sort of assistance was needed. Since the ad had included the age of a very young child, was it a nanny that was desired?<br>I said I would be pleased to take on the job of nanny.<br><br>It was Elsa, not Mitwisser, who initiated the interview though, as it turned out, she was not in charge of it. In that family she was in charge of little enough. I rode the bus to a corner populated by a cluster of small shabby stores grocery, shoemaker&#x2019;s, dry cleaner&#x2019;s, and under a tattered awning a dim coffee shop vomiting out odors of some foul stuff frying.<br><br>The windows of all these establishments were impenetrably dirty. Across the street a deserted gas station had long ago gone out of business: several large dogs scrabbled over the oil-blackened pavement and lifted their hind legs against the rusting pumps.<br><br>The address in the ad drew me along narrow old sidewalks fronting narrow old houses in what I had come to think of as the Albany style: part Hudson Gothic, part Dutch settler. But mainly old. There were bowshaped stained-glass insets over all the doors.<br>The lamps in the rooms behind them, glowing violet and amber through the lead-bordered segments of colored panes, shut me out. I thought of underground creatures kept from the light. It was November, getting on to an early dusk.<br><br>Frau Mitwisser led me into a tiny parlor so dark that it took some time before her face, small and timid as a vole&#x2019;s, glimmered into focus.<br><br> Forgive me,&#x201d; she began, Rudi wishes not the waste of electricity. We have not so much money. We cannot pay much. Food and a bed and not so many dollars.&#x201d; She stopped; her eyelids looked swollen. The tutor for my sons, it was you see . . .<br>charity. Also the beds, the linens &#x201d;<br><br>She was all apology: the slope of her shoulders, her &#xfb01;dgety hands twittering around her mouth, or reaching into the air for a phantom rope to haul her out of sight.<br>Helplessly but somehow also slyly, she was reversing our mutual obligation she appealing for my sympathy, I with the power to withhold it. It was hard to take in those pursed umlauts sprinkled through her vowels, and the throaty burr of her voice was lanced by pricks so sharp that I pulled back a little. She saw this and instantly begged my pardon.<br><br> Forgive me,&#x201d; she said again. It gives much dif&#xfb01;culty with my accent.<br>At my age to change the language is not so simple. You will see with my husband the very great difference. In his youth for four years he studies at Cambridge University in England, he becomes like an Englishman.<br>You will see. But I . . . I do not have the wie nennt man das? the idiom.&#x201d;<br><br>Her last word was shattered by an enormous thud above our heads.<br>I looked up: was the ceiling about to fall in on us? A second thud. A third.<br><br> The big ones,&#x201d; Frau Mitwisser said.<br> They make a game, to jump from the top of the . . .<br>Kleiderschrank, how you call this? I tell them every day no, but anyhow they jump.&#x201d;<br><br>This gave me a chance to restore us to business. And the littler ones?&#x201d; I asked. Do you need help with them?&#x201d;<br><br>In the dimness I glimpsed her bewilderment; it was as if she was begging for eclipse.<br><br> No, no, we go to New York so Rudi is close to the big library. Here is for him so little. The committee, it is so very kind that they give us this house, and also they make possible the work at the College, but now it is enough, Rudi must go to New York.&#x201d;<br><br>A gargantuan crash overhead: a drizzle of plaster dust landed on my sleeve.<br><br> Forgive me,&#x201d; Frau Mitwisser said.<br> Better I go upstairs now, nicht wahr?&#x201d;<br><br>She hurried out and left me alone in the dark. I buttoned up my coat; the interview, it seemed, was over. I had understood almost nothing.<br>If they didn&#x2019;t want a nanny here, what did they want? And if they had had a tutor, what had become of the tutor? Had they paid too little to keep him? On an angry impulse I switched on a lamp; the pale bulb cast a stingy yellow stain on a threadbare rug. From the condition of the sofa and an armchair, muuch abuseeeed, I gathered that the big ones&#x201d; were accustomed to assaulting the furniture downstairs as well as upstairs or else what I was seeing was thrift-shop impoverishment. A woolen shawl covered a battered little side-table, and propped on it, in a &#xfb02;ower- embossed heavy silver frame that contradicted all its surroundings, was a photograph hand-tinted, gravely posed, redolent of some incomprehensible foreignness of a dark-haired young woman in a high collar seated next to a very large plant. The plant&#x2019;s leaves were spear-shaped, serrated, and painted what must once have been a natural enough green, faded to the color of mud. The plant grew out of a great stone urn, on which the face and wings of a cherub were carved in relief.<br><br>I turned off the lamp and headed for the front door with its stained-glass inset, and was almost at the sidewalk (by now it was fully night) when I heard someone call, Fr�ulein!<br>You there! Come back!&#x201d;<br><br>The dark &#xfb01;gure of a giant stood in the unlit doorway. Those alien syllables Fr�ulein,&#x201d; yelled into the street like that put me off. Already I disliked the foreignness of this house: Elsa Mitwisser&#x2019;s dif&#xfb01;cult and resentful English, the elitist solemnity of the silver frame and its photo, the makeshift hand-me-down sitting room. These were refugees; everything about them was bound to be makeshift, provisional, resentful.<br>I would have gone home then and there, if there had been a home to go to, but it was clear that my cousin Bertram was no longer happy to have me. I was a sort of refugee myself.<br><br>(Some weeks later, when I dared to say this to Anneliese I sometimes feel like a refugee myself&#x201d; she shot me a look of purest contempt.) Like a dog that has been whistled for, I followed him back into the house.<br><br> Now we have light,&#x201d; he said, in a voice so authoritatively godlike that it might just as well have boomed Let there be light&#x201d; at the beginning of the world. He &#xfb01;ngered the lamp. Once again the faint yellow stain appeared on the rug and seeped through the room. To dispel the blackness, yes? Our circumstances have also been black. They are not so easeful. You have already seen my nervous Elsa. So that is why she leaves it to me to &#xfb01;nish the talk.&#x201d;<br><br>He was as far from resembling an Englishman as I could imagine.<br>In spite of the readier &#xfb02;ow of language (a hundred times readier than his wife&#x2019;s), he was German densely, irrevocably German. My letter was in his hands: very large hands, with big &#xfb02;attened thumbs and coarse nails, strangely humped and striated more a machinist&#x2019;s hands than a scholar&#x2019;s. In the niggardly light (twenty-&#xfb01;ve watts, I speculated) he seemed less gargantuan than the immense form in the doorway that had called me back from the street. But I was conscious of a force, of a man accustomed to dictating his conditions.<br><br> My &#xfb01;rst requirement,&#x201d; Mitwisser said, is your freedom to leave this place.&#x201d;<br><br> I can do that,&#x201d; I said. I&#x2019;d like to.&#x201d;<br><br> It is what I would like that is at issue. And what I would like is a certain engagement with I will not say ideas. But you must be able to understand what I ask of you.&#x201d;<br><br> I&#x2019;ve done most of a year of college.&#x201d;<br><br> Less than Gymnasium. What is this nonsense you write here about a nanny? How is this responsive?&#x201d;<br><br> Well, your ad mentioned children, so I thought &#x201d;<br><br> You thought mistakenly. You should know that my work has to do precisely with opposition to the arrogance of received interpretation.<br>Received interpretation is often enough simply error. Why should I not speak everywhere of my children? There is no context or relation in which they do not have a part. That is why your obligations will on occasion include them but your primary duty is to me. And you will try not to disturb my poor wife.&#x201d;<br><br>It seemed, then, that I was hired though I still did not know for what.<br><br>And it was not until a long time afterward that Anneliese con&#xfb01;ded that there had been (even in that period of crisis unemployment) no other applicants.<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Cynthia Ozick.<br>Reprinted by permission of Houghton Mifflin Company.</p><h2>The Mummy, the Will, and the Crypt: Library Edition (Johnny Dixon)</h2><p>Johnny Dixon searches a deserted mansion to find H.

Concerned that he's losing sight of the weed's ordinary days in the world, he sets out to find an example of the same plant in the wild. And so begins this unique and beautiful book&#x2015;part field notebook, part sketchbook, and part journal. Building on a narrative of the passing seasons of 2004, Harberd relates that narrative to the life history of what becomes an iconic plant. As a biologist and close observer, he is able to describe both what is visible and the hidden molecular mechanisms that underlie the visible events in the plant's life. In the process, he reveals what the daily life of a scientist truly is. </p><p>Beautifully produced, with dozens of diagrams and drawings, and written with thoughtfulness and passion, <i>Seed to Seed </i>is a testament to the wonder of the world around us.</p></p><p><p><b>Nicholas Harberd</b> is one of the world's leading plant biologists. He directs a research team at the John Innes Centre (Europe's premier plant and microbial science research institute) and is Honorary Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of East Anglia, Norwich. He is the author of numerous scientific papers and has published in the leading international journals <i>Nature </i>and <i>Science.</i></p>Even the most hardcore city dweller will be moved by British plant biologist Harberd's look at the life cycle of the thale cress plant, as he records not only the stages of a single species through one year but also provides an outline of "the unseen molecular forces that drive plants from stage to stage." Harberd engagingly shows how this common but ignored garden plant, with its short life span and small genome, is perfect for the plant geneticist, "our own <i>Drosophila</i> (fruit-fly)." Once scientists have determined its entire DNA sequence, they will be able to "get to grips with solving some of the most important questions in plant biology." Most enjoyable are Harberd's passionate observations&#x2014;from the "exhilarating" results of stem cell behavior to how the "awesome velocity" of Stravinsky's <i>Rite of Spring </i>reminds him of the "brutal in Nature"&#x2014;and how he successfully uses those observations to convey a view that "the world is a whole" and that even the most common plant can help us "see ourselves as part of something sacred. Perhaps even redefine our science as something sacramental." Illus. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Today, it's "Yes!" thanks to exciting findings from a landmark long-term study of female nurses. As described in <i>The Fertility Diet</i>, ten simple changes in diet and activity can have profound effects on fertility. You can increase your chances of getting pregnant with such simple strategies as:<p></p> <ul><li>Avoiding trans fats </li><li>Eating more beans, nuts, and other fertility-boosting plant protein </li><li>Embracing whole grains such as oatmeal and barley </li><li>Having a glass of whole milk or other full-fat dairy product every day (a small bowl of ice cream every now and then counts, too!) </li><li>Staying away from sugared sodas</li></ul> <p>The Nurses' Health Study exhaustively examined the effects of diet and other lifestyle changes on fertility among nearly 20,000 female nurses. It scrutinized everything from alcohol to vitamins.

Dillard is a veteran of <i>Star Trek</i> novelizations, having written them for the last five films. Her latest, <i>Star Trek: Insurrection</i>, finds her in fine form. The film is much lighter in tone than the last Next Generation offering, <i>First Contact</i>, and Dillard captures this relaxed mood well, transferring the humor from screen to page with a sure touch. The plot moves at a good pace as Picard and crew attempt to protect a group of peaceful Ba'ku villagers from the sinister alien Son'a and Starfleet's Admiral Dougherty, who is being less than candid about his mission. The planet has a rejuvenating effect on everyone who lands there, and this is what the Son'a, a dying race, are after. Dillard deepens the complexity of Dougherty's character, and fills in more of the background of the Ba'ku and Son'a peoples than the film had time for. The book diverges slightly from the screen version in places, presumably because Dillard was working from an earlier version of the script, but at least this means that Picard and Anij get to kiss one another! For those who enjoyed the film, this is a good way of fixing it in the memory, and it works as an exciting novel in its own right. <i>--Elizabeth Sourbut, Amazon.co.uk</i><b>J. M.

And none are more charming than the graceful, functional, sewn objects called zakka.<p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>In Japanese, zakka means &#x201c;household goods,&#x201d; referring specifically to hand-sewn items for domestic use&#x2015;tableware, kitchenware, containers of various kinds, even simple clothing. Therese Laskey and Chika Mori were enchanted by the many clever pieces they saw online but disappointed that directions and patterns were solely in Japanese. They knew they had to put together an authentic zakka book for English-speaking crafters. <p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>To do so, the authors enlisted the help of some of the best zakka makers in Japan to create 25 projects ranging from utterly simple (an appliqu�d pot holder, flower-shaped coasters) to ambitious (a house-shaped camera cozy, an adorable pair of comfy padded slippers). Each project includes easy-to-follow instructions and how-to illustrations.

Yet soon this barbaric amalgam of hardcore punk and heavy metal came to perpetually define the musical threshold of extremity. Initially circulated through a scattered tape-trading network of underground thrillseekers, bands rose from every corner of the globe and death metal and grindcore spread faster than a pandemic plague of undead flesheaters. By 1994, the genre's most prominent labels had sold well over a million death metal and grindcore albums each. Choosing Death: The Improbable History of Death Metal &amp; Grindcore examines the rise, fall, and resurrection of death metal and grindcore through the eyes and ringing ears of the artists, producers and label owners who propeled the movements. "I thought of death metal and grindcore as a return to a more extreme punk," writes the BBC's John Peel in his foreword. "This music was another step into outlaw territory beyond any aggressive music heard before."Albert Mudrian lives in Northern Virginia with his wife and their daughter and son, and the sweet memories of the 2008 Phillies, who, on their way to a World Championship,were undefeated in seven home playoff games he attended.

And that's a problem for many children, because most schools still cling to a one-size-fits-all education philosophy. As a result, these children struggle because their learning patterns don't fit the schools they are in. <br> In <i>A Mind at a Time,</i> Dr. Levine shows parents and others who care for children how to identify these individual learning patterns. He explains how parents and teachers can encourage a child's strengths and bypass the child's weaknesses. This type of teaching produces satisfaction and achievement instead of frustration and failure. <br> Different brains are differently wired, Dr. Levine explains. There are eight fundamental systems, or components, of learning that draw on a variety of neurodevelopmental capacities. Some students are strong in certain areas and some are strong in others, but no one is equally capable in all eight. Using examples drawn from his own extensive experience, Dr. Levine shows how parents and children can identify their strengths and weaknesses to determine their individual learning styles. <br> For example, some students are creative and write imaginatively but do poorly in history because weak memory skills prevent them from retaining facts. Some students are weak in sequential ordering and can't follow directions. They may test poorly and often don't do well in mathematics. In these cases, Dr. Levine observes, the problem is not a lack of intelligence but a learning style that doesn't fit the assignment. Drawing on his pioneering research and his work with thousands of students, Dr. Levine shows how parents and teachers can develop effective strategies to work through or around these weaknesses. <br> "It's taken for granted in adult society that we cannot all be 'generalists' skilled in every area of learning and mastery. Nevertheless, we apply tremendous pressure to our children to be good at <i>everything.</i> They are expected to shine in math, reading, writing, speaking, spelling, memorization, comprehension, problem solving...and none of us adults can" do all this, observes Dr. Levine. Learning begins in school but it doesn't end there. Frustrating a child's desire to learn will have lifelong repercussions. This frustration can be avoided if we understand that not every child can do equally well in every type of learning. We must begin to pay more attention to individual learning styles, to individual minds, urges Dr. Levine, so that we can maximize children's learning potential. In <i>A Mind at a Time</i> he shows us how.</p><p>Recognizing each child's intellectual, emotional, and physical strengths--and teaching directly to these strengths--is key to sculpting "a mind at a time," according to Dr. Mel Levine. While this flashing yellow light will not surprise many skilled educators, limited resources often prevent them from shifting their instructional gears. But to teachers and parents whose children face daily humiliation at school, the author bellows, "Try harder!" A professor of pediatrics at the University of North Carolina Medical School, Levine eloquently substantiates his claim that developmental growth deserves the same monitoring as a child's physical growth. <p> Tales of creative, clumsy, impulsive, nerdy, intuitive, loud-mouthed, and painfully shy kids help Levine define eight specific mind systems (attention, memory, language, spatial ordering, sequential ordering, motor, higher thinking, and social thinking). Levine also incorporates scientific research to show readers how the eight neurodevelopmental systems evolve, interact, and contribute to a child's success in school. Detailed steps describe how mental processes (like problem solving) work for capable kids, and how they can be finessed to serve those who struggle. Clear, practical suggestions for fostering self-monitoring skills and building self-esteem add the most important elements to this essential--yet challenging--program for "raisin' brain." <i>--Liane Thomas</i></p><b>Mel Levine, M.D.,</b> is professor of pediatrics at the University of North Carolina Medical School and director of its Clinical Center for the Study of Development and Learning.

In addition to providing in depth information and commentary on Gaiman&#x2019;s myriad works, the book also includes rare photographs, book covers, artwork, and related trivia and minutiae, making it both an insightful introduction to his work, and a true &#x201c;must-have&#x201d; for his ever growing legion of fans.</p></p><p><p>HANK WAGNER&#x2019;s reviews and interviews have appeared in<i> Mystery Scene, Cemetery Dance, Hellnotes, </i>and <i>The New York Review of Science Fiction.&nbsp; </i>Wagner is a co-author of <i>The Complete Stephen King Universe.</i>&nbsp;<br>CHRISTOPHER GOLDEN is the award-winning, bestselling author of&nbsp;numerous novels, of which there are 8 million copies in print.

Quixotic? Well, if anyone could justify such a splash for such a seemingly narrow-interest item, it would be the man who, more than anyone else, made the graphic novel commercially viable and whose most recent prose novel, Anansi Boys (2005), debuted at number one on the New York Times&#x2019; best-seller list: Neil Gaiman. In each of 10 parts, a different period or kind of Gaiman&#x2019;s output&#x2014;early work, the Sandman series, graphic novels, comics, novels, children&#x2019;s books, short stories, verse, screenplays, and &#x201c;oddities&#x201d;&#x2014;is described in chronology. Connections to other books, characters, and real persons are noted; quotes extracted from Gaiman&#x2019;s interviews and correspondence are provided; and remarks by his many collaborators are inserted where relevant. An eleventh part contains a highly entertaining 60-page recent interview. Other big attractions are previously unpublished writings, including a comics story and a hysterical &#x201c;special report,&#x201d; &#x201c;Who Was Jack the Ripper?&#x201d; coauthored with Eugene Byrne and Kim Newman. Because Gaiman&#x2019;s so congenial, witty, and unpretentious, there&#x2019;s lots to enjoy here, even for those who know only corners of his tremendous oeuvre. If everyone who has bought even just the Sandman series gets a copy, a second, larger printing will be in order. --Ray Olson</p><h2>College Algebra+Trigonometry-NASTA ED.</h2><p>This is already sold</p><p></p><h2>Poems of Jerusalem and Love Poems: A Bilinggual Edition (Sheep Meadow Poetry)</h2><p>This volume of work by the Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai contains two of his collections in full.

And on Lifetime's <i>The Main Ingredient,</i> demystifying cooking. And if you're lucky, you've eaten in one of Bobby Flay's three New York city restaurants. Now Bobby's using his formidable culinary talents to turn entertaining on its ear, sharing the secrets of his kitchen and making them accessible to you.<br><br>"Why make a meal that you can't enjoy with everyone else?" asks Bobby. "Let me introduce you to food that is fun!" And fun it is. Bobby's party dishes are a bold and fragrant mix. Nothing is designed specifically to be an appetizer or a main course--instead, everything is heaped in large bowls or arranged on oversized platters and set out on the table at the same time. To help you in the kitchen, recipes are organized according to where the dish is prepared or how it is served ("From the Oven," "Cool Platters"), with easy-to-find ingredients and simple-to-follow instructions. Many of the dishes or their components can be made ahead of time.</p><p>Bold, bold, bold, bold, bold! It is a word constantly associated with Bobby Flay and with good reason: he doesn't like to be subtle. "Party dishes that are bold and fragrant," "Next time you cook, take a big bold step...." "My party dishes make for a fragrant and bold mix." And yes, bold is an excellent word to describe <i>Bobby Flay's from My Kitchen to Your Table</i> (aptly subtitled <i>125 Bold Recipes</i>). Flay's genius for mixing Latin flavors and blending cuisines is indeed bold. Dishes such as Pan-Roasted Rabbit with Crushed Blackberry-Ancho Sauce and Yellow Corn-Coated Soft-shell Crabs with Red Chile-Mustard Sauce come from equal parts conviction and adventure. But best of all, these recipes work.<p> In <i>Bobby Flay's from My Kitchen to Your Table</i>, he shows how to prepare dishes that are perfect for social gatherings. These are party dishes in which the distinction between appetizer and main course is purposely blurred. Flay likes meals with attitude--lively, colorful dishes all served at once. Forget about separate courses--set out all the dishes at the same time and encourage the guests to dig in. No appetizer, accompaniment, or main course. As Flay likes to say, "it's all just food."</p><p> That is an easy statement to make if you are an award-winning chef with your own television show and author of the acclaimed <i>Bobby Flay's Bold American Food</i> (there's that word again). Still, Flay makes his food accessible. The recipes are easy to follow. And recipes that sound intimidating, such as Skewered Lamb with Rioja Red Wine Vinaigrette, are, in actuality, simple to prepare.</p><p> So take a tip from Bobby Flay: have fun with your cooking, be adventurous, exuberant, and entertaining.

Theseare the men who took the cliffs. These are thechampions who helped free a continent. Theseare the heroes who helped end a war."&#x2014;Ronald Reagan, June 6, 1984,Normandy, France<p>Acclaimed historian and author of the "New York Times" bestselling <strong>Tour of Duty</strong> Douglas Brinkley tells the riveting account of the brave U.S. Army Rangers who stormed the coast of Normandy on D-Day and the President, forty years later, who paid them homage.</p><p>The importance of Pointe du Hoc to Allied planners like General Dwight Eisenhower cannot be overstated. The heavy U.S. and British warships poised in the English Channel had eighteen targets on their bombardment list for D-Day morning. The 100-foot promontory known as Pointe du Hoc -- where six big German guns were ensconced -- was number one. General Omar Bradley, in fact, called knocking out the Nazi defenses at the Pointe the toughest of any task assigned on June 6, 1944. Under the bulldoggish command of Colonel James E. Rudder of Texas, who is profiled here, these elite forces "Rudder's Rangers" -- took control of the fortified cliff. The liberation of Europe was under way.</p><p>Based upon recently released documents from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, the Eisenhower Center, Texas A &amp; M University, and the U.S. Army Military History Institute, <strong>The Boys of Pointe du Hoc</strong> is the first in-depth, anecdotal remembrance of these fearless Army Rangers. With brilliant deftness, Brinkley moves between two events four decades apart to tell the dual story of the making of Reagan's two uplifting 1984 speeches, considered by many to be among the best orations the Great Communicator ever gave, and the actual heroic event, which was indelibly captured as well in the opening scenes of Steven Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan".Just as compellingly, Brinkley tells the story of how Lisa Zanatta Henn, the daughter of a D-Day veteran, forged a special friendship with President Reagan that changed public perceptions of World War II veterans forever. Two White House speechwriters -- Peggy Noonan and Tony Dolan -- emerge in the narrative as the master scribes whose ethereal prose helped Reagan become the spokesperson for the entire World War II generation.</p></p><p><p>Douglas Brinkley is the Katherine Tsanoff Brown Chair in Humanities and Professor of History at Rice University, a CNN Presidential Historian, and a contributing editor at <em>Vanity Fair</em>.&nbsp; In the world of public history, he serves on boards, at museums, at colleges, and for historical societies.

He lives in Austin, Texas, with his wife and three children. </p><p>&nbsp;<strong>www.douglasbrinkley.com</strong></p><p></p>Forty years to the day after American troops stormed the beaches of Normandy, the late President Ronald Reagan gave one of his best speeches. Speaking at the spot where members of the Second Ranger Battalion scaled a cliff under murderous German fire to secure a potentially lethal gun emplacement, Reagan paid homage to the valor of these young American warriors. This work tells several stories very well: the story of the Rangers, that of Ronald Reagan's own military service, and that of the writing of the speech by Peggy Noonan. At the end of the production Reagan's actual speech at Pointe du Hoc and one given not long after at Omaha Beach are presented. Brinkley, a noted historian, does a marvelous job telling his multifaceted story. Enthusiastic and winsome in his presentation, he imparts his excitement to the listener.

And even though he was better known as a prizewinning creator of fantasies and science fiction, he was equally gifted as a mystery writer--as this collection of short pieces, lovingly compiled by Richard A. Lupoff and Davidson's widow, Grania Davis, amply proves.<p> We know that writers of short stories need different sets of muscles to work their magic, which probably explains why Davidson never published a full-length mystery under his own name (although he ghosted several under the ubiquitous Ellery Queen byline). But stories in this volume such as "Thou Still Unravished Bride" (which Hitchcock made into a TV episode) and "The Cost of Kent Castwell" are perfectly contained worlds in miniature, richer than most novels.</p><p> "With a mere handful of syllables he could transport a reader to the deck of an ancient sailing vessel as it plied the waves of the sun-dappled Mediterranean, to a musty and mysterious little shop in a shadowy byway of Victorian London," Lupoff points out in his introduction.

But what of the man himself? Frances Donaldson, who first met Wodehouse in 1921, was given unique access to his most important private papers. From his blissful school days and his love affair with Hollywood to his time as a prisoner of war and his final years in America, Donaldson&#39;s definitive biography paints a luminous and affectionate portrait of the man known to his friends as &#34;Plum.&#34;</p><p><b>Frances Donaldson</b> was an award-winning biographer.

She also edited <i>Yours, Plum</i>, a collection of Wodehouse's letters.&nbsp;At the time of its 1982 release, this was the first "full-dress" biography of Wodehouse. LJ's reviewer gushed over the book, saying it contains "a wealth of information, anecdotal and otherwise and will probably stand as the best general account of the man and his writings for some time." Two decades later, Wodehouse is a popular humorist with tons of books in print and many fans, so this volume is a worthy addition to literary biography sections.

Nearby stands the tenant of the house, the beautiful and notorious Egyptian woman Ayesha Zakhari, who falls under the shadow of suspicion. Pitt&#x2019;s orders are to protect&#x2014;at all costs&#x2014;the good name of the third person in the garden: senior cabinet minister Saville Ryerson. This distinguished public servant, whispered to be Ayesha&#x2019;s lover, insists that she is as innocent as Pitt himself is. Pitt&#x2019;s journey to uncover the truth takes him from Egyptian cotton fields to the insidious London slum called Seven Dials, to a packed London courtroom where shocking secrets will at last be revealed.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>London detective Thomas Pitt is investigating the murder of a junior diplomat by a notorious Egyptian woman and her lover, a senior Cabinet minister involved in negotiating the conflict between Egypt's cotton growers and England's textile industry. Lovat, the diplomat, once served in Egypt, and to unravel the mystery of his death, Pitt travels to Alexandria, where he finds that the beautiful Ayesha Zakhari is not who she appears to be--and that Lovat's murder may be tied to an old crime which, if exposed, could set the Middle East aflame. While Pitt is in Egypt, his wife, Charlotte, occupies herself with a more mundane matter--the disappearance of a valet whose sister is a friend of the Pitt's housemaid. It's not long before the reader realizes the connection between the two crimes; meanwhile, Perry layers this smoothly plotted mystery with a fascinating history of Egypt in the days of the British Empire and the religious and economic tensions whose repercussions still resonate more than a century later. Perry, the author of two Victorian-era series (the other stars investigator William Monk), does her usual fine job of bringing the colorful time period alive, helped along by the details of domestic life provided by her protagonists' wives, interesting and accomplished women who have lately played all but equal roles in solving their husbands' cases. <i>--Jane Adams</i><b>&#x201c;An Anne Perry novel is a delight to read as much for its Victorian-era details as for the mystery it unfolds.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>Chicago Tribune<br><br></i>&#x201c;A MASTER OF CRIME FICTION.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2013;The Baltimore Sun<br></i></b><br><b><br>Praise for Anne Perry&#x2019;s previous<br>Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novel<br><i>Southampton Row</i><br></b><br>&#x201c;Compelling and provocative . . .

Out of that experience came Red Star Over China, a classic work that remains one of the most important books ever written about the birth of the Communist movement in China. This edition includes extensive notes on military and political developments in China, further interviews with Mao Tse-tung, a chronology covering 125 years of Chinese revolution, and nearly a hundred detailed biographies of the men and women who were instrumental in making China what it is today.</p><p>&#x201c;A journalistic scoop in 1937, this book has since become a historical classic. When Snow made his way through Nationalist lines to the barren reaches of Shensi Province in June 1936, the communists had only recently emerged, exhausted and decimated, from their 6,000-mile Long March. Snow found them developing the distinctive brand of communism that governed the lives of the Chinese people during the Maoist era and that only in recent years has begun to change under the impact of Deng Xiaoping's reforms. Many of the men Snow interviewed in 1936 were the first- generation leaders of communist China. The best-known section of the book is Mao's autobiography as related to Snow, which is still one of the most important documents on that subject. Another important section is the graphic description of the Long March. Snow's sympathetic portrayal of the Chinese communists is somewhat naive, however, and it exposed him to widespread criticism during the McCarthy years.&#x201d;&#x2015;Donald Zagoria, <i>Foreign Affairs</i></p><h2>Fatigue: Fight It with the Blood Type Diet</h2><p>A guide for preventing and treating fatigue is based on the author&#39;s Blood Type Diet strategies and explains how to customize a personal program for eating, exercising, and living in accordance with one&#39;s specific needs, in a handbook complemented by self-assessment tests and the author&#39;s new &#34;Super Beneficial&#34; disease-fighting food section. 10,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Dr. Peter J.

One of the most important success stories in wild game management has been the recovery of our wild sheep populations. <i>Return of Royalty: Wild Sheep of North America</i> is a celebration of the return of wild sheep to many of its historical ranges. <p>The unregulated hunting of the pioneer days and disease from the introduction of domestic livestock nearly decimated wild sheep populations in North America by the late nineteenth century. Within four decade's time, the all-time low of 9,000 bighorn sheep in 1960 has been replaced today by an impressive number of 70,000 sheep. This remarkable recovery has been documented in a new book by two widely-respected wildlife biologists (Drs. Dale E. Toweill and Valerius Geist) and provides fascinating accounts of the decline and recovery of North American wild sheep in every state or province where wild herds exist. </p><p>The authors have compiled a wealth of condensed information on wild sheep evolution, behavior and management, and a perspective on the importance of sheep to the lives of Native Americans and explorers. This book includes state-by-state accounts of each race of sheep; historic numbers; transplants and restoration efforts; and present day numbers and distribution. Each account offers current maps of distribution and includes photographs of wild sheep, and sheep habitat, for each state or province. </p><p>Toweill and Geist also provide their insights into wild sheep management for the future - identifying landmark projects such as the Hells Canyon Initiative, National Parks Wild Sheep Restoration effort, and new programs to "create" wild sheep habitat. </p><p>Although written by professional wildlife biologists, this book is nontechnical and is intended for a diverse audience of conservationists, photographers, sportsmen, and everyone who enjoys wild sheep.

Native American cultures value an end to isolation and the individuals's return to family and tribe, but there are some striking analogs to Western myths; one Pima story neatly parallels the Noah's ark tale. Curiosities include "She-Who-Changeth" for the more common "Changing Woman," gender-exclusive language (" . . . man first appeared . . .

Overturning long-cherished notions, John Keane poses challenging questions: Did democracy actually begin in ancient Greece or earlier in Mesopotamia? Do the American and British systems actually live up to their democratic ideals? Why is there a bad moon rising over the world&#x2019;s democracies? Written by a leading political theorist, this book presents readers with a counterintuitive look at democracy&#x2019;s past, present, and future, which Keane argues lies not in the West but in the turbulent democracies of the East, especially in India. Avoiding the triumphalism of global democracy&#x2019;s most boisterous pundits, Keane cautions that democracy today is more fragile than ever and that, unless major corrective measures are taken, we may be sleepwalking our way into even deeper trouble.</p><p>John Keane, a professor of politics at the University of Westminster and the director of the Centre for the Study of Democracy, is the author of many books, including the widely translated The Media and Democracy. He lives in London.Starred Review. Looking beyond the Athens-Runnymede-Philadelphia axis, political scholar Keane (<i>Tom Paine</i>) traces democracy's roots back to Sumeria and follows its tendrils as far afield as Pitcairn Island and Papua New Guinea. (A revelatory chapter on India's banyan democracy suggests that democracy's center of gravity has shifted decisively eastward.) Less interested in theory than actuality, he gives Locke, Madison and their ilk short shrift to make room for engrossing profiles of obscure politicians and reformers&#x2014;medieval Spain's <i>cortes</i> (parliaments); Jos� Batlle y Ord��ez, president of Uruguay in the early 20th century; the Australian progressives who pioneered proportional representation and women's suffrage&#x2014;whose efforts built democracy from the ground up. Democracy thus emerges as less a set of fixed principles than a culture and mindset&#x2014;pragmatic, antiauthoritarian, accepting of change and contingency and the ability of ordinary people to shape them. Keane's lack of theoretical rigor sometimes tells; his vision of a developing monitory democracy, characterized by a hypervigilant civil society, all-seeing media and viral politics seems more faddish than focused. But his study's broad sweep, wealth of detailed knowledge, shrewd insights and fluent, lively prose make it a must-read for scholars and citizens alike.

For years, he was wont to tell the tale during late-night drinking matches, and after one particularly heavy-duty night of partying, he awoke to find a bet scrawled pillowside: a friend wagered 100 pounds that Hawks wouldn't travel Ireland for a month with a refrigerator at his side.<p> Out of this stupid premise, a ridiculously amusing book was born. Quickly discovered by the Irish media, the thumbing Englishman finds that he and his box fridge are elevated to celebrity status, and there's no dearth of rides, places to stay, or goofy people to meet, from kings to spoons players to locals who take his fridge surfing. As insightful about the strange inner workings of Hawk's mind as it is about charming peculiarities of Irishmen--it's doubtful that Hawks would have been similarly embraced by Germans, Italians, or the French--<i>Round Ireland with a Fridge</i> is an entirely silly, heartwarming tale told in a rollicking funny and refreshing style. <i>--Melissa Rossi</i></p>"Part autobiography, part travelogue, part Guinness-addled ramblings." -<i>The Irish Times</i></p><h2>Jane Welsh Carlyle: And Her Victorian World</h2><p>Jane Welsh Carlyle and Her Victorian World</p><p>Kathy Chamberlain has lectured on Jane Welsh Carlyle at the CUNY Graduate Center and at conferences in the US and UK, and has published numerous essays about Jane Welsh Carlyle and Virginia Woolf, writing reviews for the Virginia Woolf Society of Great Britain.`We can meet this witty, highly intelligent, sprightly, and politically aware woman - everything that Jane was -in Kathy Chamberlain&#39;s engagingly written biography&#39; * Deirdre Bair, biographer of Samuel Beckett * `Compelling, readable, and utterly distinct in its approach...

New studies show that Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease is the number three cause of death in developed countries, behind heart disease and cancer. But there is good news: We now have the knowledge to extend both lifespan and <i>mindspan,</i> helping to ensure that our minds and bodies stay in peak form at any age.<br><br> Studying the diets of the &#x201c;Mindspan Elite&#x201d;&#x2014;those populations that live longest with low levels of dementia&#x2014;as well as the ways that certain food additives and ingredients interact with our genes, Dr. Preston Estep explains how the recent slew of popular brains-and-aging books have steered us down the wrong dietary path. Shattering myths about which foods are (and are not) beneficial to our brains, <i>The Mindspan Diet </i>reveals a simple plan to slow cognitive decline. Startling in its revelations about healthy eating for those over the age of forty, it challenges us to rethink our approach to many common staples, including:<br><br> <b>� Iron: </b>While iron-fortified foods sound healthy, high iron intake can be toxic, especially for people over forty, and increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer&#x2019;s, and Parkinson&#x2019;s disease.<br> <b>� Whole grains: </b>Processed grains such as white rice, pasta, and flour are actually staples in the diets of cultures with the best cognitive health.<br> <b>� Protein: </b>Though it&#x2019;s considered by some to be a miracle macronutrient, high levels of protein are actually hard on the kidneys, and may promote cancer and accelerate the progression of dementia.<br><br> Complete with food recommendations, shopping lists, advice on reading nutrition labels, and more than seventy delicious recipes, <i>The Mindspan Diet</i> shows that you can enjoy the richest flavors life has to offer and remain lean, healthy, and cognitively intact for a very long life.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Mindspan Diet<br></i></b><br>&#x201c;Eye-opening . . . fascinating, important . . .

It&#x2019;s the things we know that just ain&#x2019;t so.<br><br>&#x2014;Probably said first by Henry Wheeler Shaw (pen name Josh Billings), but also attributed to Artemus Ward and to Mark Twain<br><br>Our highest aspiration should be to make our mindspans soar&#x2014;to maximize both longevity and mental performance. With our best possible minds we can confidently tackle the most challenging problems; we can better forecast and plan for the future; and we can live the fullest and happiest lives. In other words, we can experience and do everything better. Now, however, we face our days with less certainty and confidence.<br><br>According to recent polls, Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease is the most feared diagnosis. Some of our uncertainty and fear about the future comes from the lack of scientific consensus on the most healthful path forward. There are all manner of claims, from hopelessly bleak to hopeful and inspiring. Some say nothing can prevent or substantially slow the decline. Others say cognitive decline can be stopped and even reversed by some implausible miracle cure. Both are wrong. I selected the Josh Billings quote to head this chapter because, of all the health-related information that inundates us these days, critical parts just ain&#x2019;t so. They just ain&#x2019;t. And, as Mr. Billings said, that gets us into trouble.<br><br>Choosing a Diet<br><br>I have seen and heard about countless diets over the decades. Most focus on weight loss, others on physical fitness or athletic performance, some on health. These are all laudable goals, but neglect what is most important: the long-term performance and health of your mind&#x2014;and the minds of your loved ones. Think about being a caretaker for many years for someone you love as he or she slowly descends into the abyss of mental darkness we call dementia. Now reverse the roles and picture your loved ones caring for you as all of your memories and relationships fade one by one, leaving them to care for your progressively debilitated body and your ravaged mind. We want to remember the best of our loved ones, but it is difficult to disregard the repeated questions, odd behaviors, incontinence, and the like. The only reasonable goal in choosing a diet is maximum mindspan.<br><br>In recent years, both fatty foods and carbs have been vilified. Common assertions are that we&#x2019;re being poisoned by our foods, we&#x2019;re suffering from our bounty, and our diets and health are worse than ever. I agree generally with the first two of these claims, but not with the specifics. As for the state of our diets, in some important ways, they are better than ever. But that doesn&#x2019;t stop the grim downpour of gripes and the rising tide of misguided solutions.<br><br>Some health gurus harken back to bygone days. They say if we could go back many millennia we&#x2019;d see people living in pristine health. As we&#x2019;d chat around the campfire with our cave kin, they&#x2019;d be amazed by our descriptions of computers, cellphones, and routine airplane travel while being equally puzzled by our relatively recent ailments such as heart attacks, cancer, and dementia. These gurus are fascinated by our Paleolithic ancestors&#x2019; health, speculating as to why, for example, starches made up such a tiny fraction of their daily diet. <br><br>While our kin of millennia ago were leaner and far more active and diabetes was much less common, the juiciest parts of these stories&#x2014;especially those used to justify currently popular Paleo diets&#x2014;come from imaginations gone wild. Genetic evidence shows that over time humans have been evolving an increasing ability to digest starches and sugars. (Today, for example, we produce more than five times the amount of digestive enzymes needed to break down starches as chimps, our closest ape relatives.) The changes with the largest effect date to at least 50,000 years ago, which contradicts the belief that starch consumption is recent and therefore evolutionarily unimportant.<br><br>Scientists agree that diseases of older age such as heart disease, cancer, and dementia were less common many thousands of years ago&#x2014;but primarily because old age as we know it was less common. In fact, mummies from around the world are found with cancer, atherosclerosis, arthritis, and other diseases, which appear to have been at least as common then as they are now when age is taken into account.<br><br>If we flash back to the turn of the twentieth century, we&#x2019;ll see that the current ailments of old age were common. In fact, the age-adjusted rates of cardiovascular diseases&#x2014;which remain leading killers today&#x2014;occurred more frequently, as did age-adjusted rates of other deadly diseases, such as pathogenic infections.<br><br>Still, more than a hundred years later, it is clear we have some big problems, one of which is that many people have an unnecessarily high risk of cognitive impairment. It is very disturbing that as people and countries become wealthier, cognitive problems in later life become more common. But to see the best direction forward in dealing with such risks, we must get our facts straight.<br><br>Maximum Mindspan Means Optimal Health<br><br>Mindspan translates to longevity and performance of the mind, and it is the ultimate measure of overall long-term health. If the cardiovascular system is in poor shape, blood flow to the brain is impaired. Similarly, poorly functioning kidneys, lungs, or liver also impact mental performance. It is therefore unsurprising that a host of leading health problems, including diabetes and high cholesterol, are risk factors for mental decline. Optimal health and longevity of the body come baked into the overall recipe for achieving maximum mindspan. If you are eating a conventional diet&#x2014;even one typically considered healthful&#x2014;my dietary program will reduce your risk of all killer diseases.<br><br>Mindspan Rising, Mindspan Falling<br><br>First, the good news: We&#x2019;ve made impressive headway in just the last few generations, both in overall longevity and in performance of the mind. Over the last 150 years, industrialized countries have achieved the greatest longevity increases in history. Improved prenatal care and reduced infant mortality have driven huge gains not just in overall life expectancy, but in adult years too. My great-grandparents were born just before the turn of last century. When they were children in the year 1900, a seventy-year-old woman living in the United States could expect to live about nine more years, a statistic that has increased to fifteen years today. And recent trends in record long life show accelerating growth. Between 2000 and 2010, the percentage of centenarians (age one hundred and up) of many populations increased dramatically&#x2014;even more than doubling in some, including in Japan, which leads the world in longevity.<br><br>The realm of the mind has experienced similar gains. Modern mental testing didn&#x2019;t become common until after the turn of the twentieth century; but once started and applied widely, testing showed gradual increases similar to those observed for longevity. The mental realm is highly complex and important changes are less easily measured than those in longevity, but measured gains in memory, IQ, and other cognitive functions are impressive: reportedly as high as 25 percent over the twentieth century. As with life expectancy, previous increases of this magnitude likely took many times longer.<br><br>While these gains are most often measured in children and adolescents, tests on adults show gains across the board, including in older adults (which is one of the important developments opposing the trend toward increased dementia as people live longer). In other words, it appears people are living longer than ever at about the highest-ever cognitive level. According to these mental test data, adults today are more intelligent than those of generations ago. The fact that these gains are both substantial and persist into later years shows they are at least as impressive as gains in overall longevity. Sensationalist headlines like &#x201c;Aging Reversal Process Discovered!&#x201d; aside, these two important types of gains are synergistic and together constitute increasing mindspan.<br><br>When we look deeper into the historical and global trends of rising mindspan, there is reason for hope . . . but also for serious worry. And unfortunately the bad news seems pretty grim. Mindspans of some developing nations are still on the rise, but there are alarming signs that mindspan growth has plateaued in developed nations. Most concerning, recent reports suggest that dementias and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson&#x2019;s are already much higher in developed nations (comparing people of the same age), and might still be on the rise in the United States, Europe, and most other affluent nations of the world. Some of these reports suggest that many in higher-risk countries begin to develop memory problems as early as their forties.<br><br>According to a recent study, &#x201c;deaths from Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease and other dementias rose more than three-fold, and deaths from Parkinson&#x2019;s disease doubled&#x201d; globally between 1990 and 2010. It&#x2019;s not just longevity driving this trend. These diseases appear to be increasing in frequency at every age, and in fact the age-standardized death rate from Alzheimer&#x2019;s and other dementias doubled over just two decades.<br><br>However, even this alarming trend might seriously underestimate the magnitude of both current and future problems. Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease is responsible for over 500,000 deaths annually in the United States, which is six times higher than the official estimate of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This level of mortality makes Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease the number three killer (maybe even number two) and suggests that it could become the number one killer in the near future. You may have been hearing for years of the coming wave of dementia as the baby boom generation ages, but this study&#x2014;and others&#x2014;shows that the worrisome wave is likely to become a devastating tsunami if this trend isn&#x2019;t reversed very soon.<br><br>Getting a Grip<br><br>Our genes haven&#x2019;t changed in the past two or three decades, but our foods, diets, and lifestyles have&#x2014;radically. But I believe we can reduce risk to far below what it was even before then. Why? Because many independent strands of solid scientific evidence tell us that we have substantial control over mindspan. Dietary and lifestyle factors in developed countries have contributed negatively to dementia rates, yet certain stealth factors have produced the opposite effect. The Rolling Stones famously lamented that &#x201c;you can&#x2019;t always get what you want,&#x201d; but I say sometimes you get more of a good thing when trying to get something else. Some of the gains in longevity and cognition have come from a focus on comfort and quality of life. As discussed at length in later chapters, coffee, tea, and red wine are flavorful ways to improve energy and mood, and certain modern pain relievers like ibuprofen reduce inflammation, but they also reduce dementia and produce other benefits. People seeking immediate mood or energy tweaks or relief from the pain of a bad back or balky knee have achieved long-term cognitive side benefits without intending to.<br><br>Other factors that have produced increased mindspan as side benefits include improved sanitation, water and food abundance and quality, and a range of other public health measures. But while these gains may have come easily, we&#x2019;ve probably reaped most of the benefits we can from them. If we want to make more headway, we need to look for new sources. Even greater future mindspan gains are possible, but going forward, we need to apply key scientific knowledge and technologies more thoughtfully and precisely.<br><br>Eating Better as You Age<br><br>The second half of life is regarded somewhat differently across cultures, but one universal among them is that older means wiser, and thus we tend to entrust older people with more responsibility. Here in the United States, where we have a law that restricts the office of the presidency to people thirty-five and older, the average age at the start of all presidential terms is fifty-five, and our youngest president&#x2014;John F. Kennedy&#x2014;was just shy of his forty-fourth birthday when he took office. Even in countries without such laws, ultimate responsibility is almost always given to someone well into the second half of life; in the United Kingdom between 1800 and today, for example, the average age a prime minister first took office is about fifty-six.<br><br>People begin to slow down physically before this peak in wisdom and leadership (some have even theorized that this physical slowdown is an essential part of the rise to emotional and mental maturity). The technical term for this slowdown is senescence. But we don&#x2019;t just get slower, our needs actually change. We respond differently to food, drink, exercise, and sleep, among other things. Over the decades of the second half of life, these changes add up, as do the benefits or costs of our choices. The importance of this change is underscored by focusing on the leading risk factors for Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease.<br><br>Mainstream science has identified the most important genetic contributors to Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease (which we&#x2019;ll discuss in detail in chapter 5). The medical community has pursued treatments to correct the problem caused by one of these genes. Yet most experts don&#x2019;t realize that the interaction of this gene with a ubiquitous environmental trigger negatively impacts cognitive functioning in virtually all older people.<br><br>Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease is diagnosed in less than 10 percent of Western populations, but according to the Alzheimer&#x2019;s Association, less than half of Alzheimer&#x2019;s sufferers or their caregivers are told of their diagnosis (possibly because so many believe nothing can be done anyway). It&#x2019;s also widely believed that an additional 10 to 20 percent of people suffer from other lesser or unrelated forms of dementia. Some estimates using relaxed criteria say more than 40 percent have some impairment. But even this figure underestimates the extent of age-dependent cognitive compromise. As chapter 5 explains in detail, most cases of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease and dementia have the same primary genetic cause, and it is not an uncommon genetic variant. In fact, this root genetic cause is so common it is nearly universal.<br><br>All forms of dementia also have common environmental causes, such as the ingredients in our foods. The public remains unaware of these dangers despite being assaulted by them every day. At the moment it is impossible to prove which influence cognition more, genetic or dietary factors, but my belief is that diet has a substantial and possibly greater capacity to either increase or decrease mindspan. Many dietary factors act as volume controls to turn the level of genes up or down or as switches to turn them on or off. In fact, iron is a primary dietary risk for neurodegeneration and dementia because it turns up the volume on this key gene that increases the risk of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease.<br><br>Diet: The Mindspan Maximizer<br><br>Currently we cannot change our genes, but we can change how they behave with a few potent factors: exercise and physical activity, sleep, drugs, and even our state of mind. But diet exerts the most profound and lasting effect. The critical role of diet isn&#x2019;t very surprising, given that a typical person will eat about forty tons of food in a lifetime.<br><br>An outstanding dietary and lifestyle pattern reduces risk of heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular complications by 90 percent or more. The Lyon, France, heart study produced a 76 percent reduction in all-cause mortality by boosting the Mediterranean components in the diets of people already eating typical French diets&#x2014;which are better and result in fewer cardio...</p><h2>The Hiding Place (Walker Large Print Books)</h2><p>Translated into more than twenty languages, a classic of twentieth-century religious literature recounts the author's efforts to help Jews escape the Nazi death camps as a member of the Dutch resistance in Holland.

The three recent tales included in this small, illustrated collection, however, show a certain mellowing. They are touristy romantic fantasies, all set in a Mayan region of the Yucatan Peninsula, the Quintana Roo. The heavy psychological freight that weighed down the earlier work remains, but the Mayans have been tritely cast in place of Tiptree's inscrutable aliens. In fact, her self-proclaimed "Mayaphilia" turns the Indians into one-dimensional objects of uncritical worship. Finally, these ghosts, gods incarnate and oceanic apparitions are pallid inventions with less impact than the unpleasant drawings that accompany them here. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>When Homosexuality Hits Home: What to Do When a Loved One Says They&#39;re Gay</h2><p><p>"There's something I need to tell you...I'm gay."</p><p>These are hard words to hear from a beloved family member.

He lives in Melrose, Massachusetts.</p><h2>Tonight at Noon: A Love Story</h2><p>In <i>Tonight at Noon</i>, Sue Graham Mingus gives us an elegant and unsparingly honest memoir of a romance <br>between American opposites: she, a product of privilege, a former midwestern WASP debutante and Smith College graduate who worked as a journalist in Europe and in New York; he, an authentic jazz titan, a brilliant, eccentric, difficult artist, a scion of Watts, Los Angeles, who would become one of America&#x2019;s foremost composers.<br><br>Charles Mingus&#x2019;s improbable love for Sue Graham, his unpredictable confrontations, excesses, and exaggerations, drew her into a bewildering world, one where jazz and art were magnificent obsessions but were refracted, as was everything else, through Charles&#x2019;s individualistic interpretation of life itself. It was a world that was as exotic and rapturous, as hostile, enlightening, and baffling, as any far-off country. <i>Tonight at Noon</i> is the story of that world, of the tumultuous, passionate marriage of Sue and Charles Mingus, and of Sue&#x2019;s personal odyssey inside and outside its confines.<br><br>Here is a love story&#x2014;heartbreaking, joyous, and unforgettable&#x2014;that also illumines an important chapter in jazz history and the inner workings of a rare and complex artist, whose music, thanks to his widow, still plays to packed concert halls almost twenty-five years after his death.</p><p>Sue Graham Mingus, a former magazine editor and publisher, is currently a music producer. She has created and directs repertory ensembles that carry on the music of Charles Mingus.One<br><br>I met Charles Mingus shortly before midnight in July 1964. I'd gone down to the Five Spot, a jazz club in lower Manhattan, because the producer of a film I was acting in had commissioned a jazz soundtrack from saxophonist Ornette Coleman&#x2013;at least he thought he had commissioned a soundtrack&#x2013;and my friend Sam Edwards, who was working on the film, suggested I check out the scene. I didn't know the first thing about jazz. Sam warned me I was not with it, especially for someone in New York, but added in his usual upbeat fashion that anyone could learn. Members of the cast had given me an Ornette Coleman album called <i>Something Else</i>, and I had listened over and over to a Miles Davis record called <i>Miles Ahead</i>, because the director of the film had played it over and over in the apartment where we were shooting during the long intervals between takes. That was the extent of my baptism into the music.<br><br>Sam picked me up at my apartment on the Upper West Side and we headed down to the Village Gate, where the trumpet player Dizzy Gillespie was performing. Around midnight when Dizzy's set ended, we drove across town to the Five Spot to hear Mingus. In those days the Five Spot was one of the liveliest jazz hangouts in New York City. Jazz was peaking and both Charles Mingus and Thelonious Monk, who had recently appeared on the cover of <i>Time </i>magazine, could play at the same place for six months straight and keep people coming. It was a time, Sam explained, when Charles Mingus was referred to in the press as jazz's angry man.<br><br>I'd barely heard of Mingus, though echoes of his reputation had filtered down: the ornery, sometimes violent, often unjust, blustery figure who fired his musicians onstage, hired them back, denounced the audience for inattention, picked fights, mastered his instrument, dominated his music, vented his political beliefs on stage, presented a larger-than-life personality, and created on-the-spot performances for all to see. He was the essence of a sixties "happening," people said&#x2013;those spontaneous events of the era that were everywhere around town.<br><br>Intermission had just begun when we arrived, and musicians were still lingering near the stage. We found a couple of seats at the bar and Sam ordered me a gin and tonic. I was unwinding from a visit home to my dad's&#x2013;not really home, which had been Milwaukee, but my father's retirement place in Florida where I'd gone to discuss family problems: mine, marital and economic; his, an end- of-life hobbling illness.<br><br>He'd discovered that my phone wasn't working when he tried to call, and when I told him my marriage was close to being off the hook as well, he'd suggested I come down to talk it over. I'd soaked up the sun during our long discussions and now, back in New York, was hoping to blur the details of life for a few more hours, relaxing in a club. I was tanned and dressed in off-white clothes from head to toe. "Like a bottle of milk," Sam said, laughing, when he saw my cream-colored ensemble&#x2013;skirt, blouse, matching summer heels. "You could be a blurb for your home state. America's Dairyland in linen."<br><br>I informed him it was silk, not linen, and that even my father had complimented me at the airport&#x2013;an event I was still savoring, considering that our family had always avoided praise. For once, I said, Mom's convent ghosts were not kicking in. Sam knew about the Convent of the Sacred Heart where my mom had spent her childhood. I'd told him about the prestigious finishing school for Catholic young ladies whose rituals and distaste for excess and display were as alive and disapproving six decades later as they had been at the turn of the century.<br><br>I was touched by the unlikely attention my father had lavished on me earlier in the day and couldn't help bragging to Sam as we sat together on our stools, waiting for the music to begin.<br><br>"He gazed at my silk dress, my high heels and jewelry&#x2013;I'm not usually so dressed up&#x2013;and he saw my pinned-up hair, a whiff of hairspray holding it in place, and he told me I was a beautiful woman. Perhaps it was the first time he saw me. I think he was proud." The waiter had set down my drink and then run off to get Sam's, which he'd forgotten. "Of course he was shy about it, it was such an intimate thing to say. We never talked about looks in our family, you know. I don't remember compliments at all&#x2013;not even about our accomplishments. They were dangerously linked to vanity in Mom's mind. And then, of course, my parents had expectations; you were expected to do well without flattery or approval. That's how they were." I looked at Sam. "I mean, my brothers and I didn't feel deprived."<br><br>I was aware that I was justifying what might seem like a spartan fear of excess or of personal expression.<br><br>"Well, here's to fatherly praise." Sam raised his glass. After surveying the room, he pointed to someone at a distant table and said it was Mingus. I'd already noticed the individual who was eating alone at a table for four, a man so aloof and removed from the late-night mob around him that he seemed like a remote island plunked down by accident in a sea of people. His sleeves were rolled up, a steak bone was in his fist, and his eyes were focused on the round plate of food before him, as intense and private as a holy man meditating on his chakra. He looked as if he might lavish the same brooding intensity on everything he touched. For the moment it happened to be his dinner.<br><br>I liked him immediately. I liked his aloneness in the tumultuous room, his concentration on the outsized beef bone at hand. He was consumed in the act of eating, lost in the pleasure of it despite the Saturday night frenzy and noisy tourist crowd around him, an unself-conscious, perspiring, focused man, exposed and unimpressed, a man too concentrated within himself for fear. My own life had been one of order and balance, founded on grammar and taste and impeccable manners, and yet something about the man across the room seemed oddly familiar, like someone I already knew, a relation in the family, some critical presence or weight like my father, looming beyond scale or size&#x2013;although Mingus was not physically heavy then, nor was my father ever. I suppose now that it was just some soothsayer wraith blowing down my neck, some fanciful wind from the future revealing for an instant, like a photo developed too soon and out of sequence, the far-off snapshot ahead.<br><br>There is a tiny snapshot on my wall at home, centered inside an oversized frame. It is myself, aged five, a postage stamp of childhood. In the tattered photo I am flanked by two stalwart nannies who grasp my hands. They are tall and erect and stand at attention. Even now I can feel my hands locked in theirs. They were in charge of running the kitchen, in charge of me. Although orders came from above&#x2013;from my mother who watched scrupulously over the preparation of food, the table settings, the lighting of candelabra, the preparation of my hair with a hot curling iron each morning before school&#x2013;they ran interference for her and upheld the law.<br><br>Our meals were formal occasions at which my brothers wore ties and freshly ironed shirts, a bell summoned the maids, and my father carved at the head of the table. Although formalities were altered when the war broke out and young women could earn a better, more independent living working in defense factories instead of serving in homes, dinners remained a crucial ritual that continued long afterward. They were a branding iron of form that burned through our lives and those of our children, whatever our circumstances. Even years later, in the days when I ran a newspaper and held frequent boisterous editorial meetings/banquets at home, Charles sprawled large and brooding over his favorite dishes at the head of the table, we consumed our meals under flickering candles, sat straight before our place settings, and covered our laps with linen. The corruption of table manners remained unthinkable. It was linked forever with the echoes of Mom's vivid descriptions of her early convent discipline&#x2013;the gothic punishments for a small elbow leaning on the dining table or a mistaken choice among the silver forks.<br><br>The expressions of the women in the snapshot are stern and protective beneath hats that slant rakishly low over their foreheads. Their long coats are slightly open; perhaps it is the first mild day at the end of winter, though the trees in the distance are bare, suggesting several weeks before spring. The women's lives are not about to blossom either, one imagines, although they are young enough and perhaps&#x2013;but no, I cannot imagine them as anything but jailkeepers. Outfitted in a double-breasted coat with matching hat, I squint irritably at my father with his box camera, my hands locked in theirs. One day I will escape to Europe, marry a freethinking Italian sculptor, and, when he dies, marry Charles. It is already written in the snapshot.<br><br>But wait, there is another picture beside it&#x2013;my mother, still young, taken by a professional photographer. She is beautiful and wears a beige linen dress, seated on a white wooden bench in the garden. She is carefree and gracious and without disappointment, years before her suicide. She holds a protective hand behind me as I balance on top of the bench and squint into the sun, seemingly unfettered. I am allowed my acrobatics, allowed to climb tall trees and back fences and explore the carefully designed world that is offered. I am given an illusion of independence, an abiding sense of freedom and the right to claim that freedom, that will last a lifetime.<br><br>As I watched, Mingus rose from the table and shouldered his way through the crowd. When he reached the bar, a bearded young man who was standing near us complained to him about Dizzy Gillespie's antics onstage at the very club Sam and I had just left. "Did you listen to him play?" Mingus responded immediately. Before the young man could reply, he continued...</p><h2>The Trojan War in Ancient Art</h2><p>The myths of the Trojan War captured the imagination not only of Greek and Roman authors such as Homer, Euripides, Virgil and Ovid, but also inspired countless Greek and Roman painters and sculptors. Following the course of the war, and exploring its representation in vase paintings, murals and sculptures, this study demonstrates the liberating flexibility of Greek mythology.</p><p><p> "Few books on mythology, or on ancient art, provide such good reading as Woodford's lively treatment of the myths and tales associated with the Trojan War. In an understated manner, with excellent narrative and amusing treatment throughout, she regales the reader with the wonder of the stories and the humor of the situations in which both gods and people find them- selves. Carefully chosen pictures, drawn largely from Greek vase painting, but also from Roman wail paintings, mosaics, and sculpture, make a rich tapestry of illustrative material." &#x2015;<em>Classical World</em> (1997)</p></p><h2>Ranma 1/2, Vol. 14</h2><p>Follows the adventures of half-boy, half-girl martial artist Ranma, whose transforming gender problems began at the Accursed Springs in China when he became cursed to turn into a girl when splashed with cold water, and back into a boy with hot water.</p><p>The spotlight on Rumiko Takahashi&#39;s career began in 1978 when she won an honorable mention in Shogakukan&#39;s annual New Comic Artist Contest for Those Selfish Aliens. Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, Urusei Yatsura, was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday. This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another--Maison Ikkoku ran from 1980 to 1987, Ranma 1/2 from 1987 to 1996, and Inuyasha from 1996 to 2008. Other notable works include Mermaid Saga, Rumic Theater, and One-Pound Gospel. Takahashi won the Shogakukan Manga Award twice in her career, once for Urusei Yatsura in 1981 and the second time for Inuyasha in 2002. A majority of the Takahashi canon has been adapted into other media such as anime, live-action TV series, and film.&#34;</p><h2>Modern Classics Complete Novels Of George Orwell</h2><p>Winston Smith is an average citizen who is of the middle-class in the super-state of Oceania.

He hoped he could save the POWs held in the St. Nazaire prison camp. The prisoners were cold, hungry, and becoming deathly ill. They needed help, and quickly.</p><p>On that dismal predawn morning in late November, a cold rain spattered the sleeping French countryside. Andy placed a white flag in the jeep&#x2019;s front holder, climbed inside, and began his trek toward enemy lines. Probably, no one expected his arrival on this day. In his hand, he carried a copy of a letter, dated November 21, 1944, typed in German on American Red Cross stationery. It was addressed to the camp&#x2019;s <i>Kommandant</i>&#x2014;whoever he was.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>An den Deutschen Kommandanten, St. Nazaire</i>,&#x201d; it said. That&#x2019;s all.

He wanted to be there, sitting in his chair around the big family table, with his new bride and toddler son, his parents, brothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, and longtime friends. He could almost smell and taste the traditional oven-baked turkey and cornbread dressing, marshmallow-crowned sweet potato casserole, last summer&#x2019;s homegrown canned tomatoes, and pumpkin pies his family would feast on that day. But the whole world was at war, and he had his orders.</p><p><i>Dinners at home will have to wait&#x2014;till next year, or the year after that</i>.<i> I sure hope I get to sit at my family&#x2019;s Thanksgiving table again one day.</i></p><p>As he drove slowly down the narrow path from Ch�teaubriant, he shined his flashlight on the old, crinkled map of France, the only one he could find.

Stay left along the Rue de Nantes</i>.</p><p>Andy&#x2019;s sense of direction wasn&#x2019;t so bad, but, except for a few words, he knew no French.</p><p><i>Maybe if I&#x2019;d played less football and studied more languages in college, I&#x2019;d be better equipped for this mission</i>. <i>At least I could read this map.</i></p><p>He worried about the accuracy of the faded map for the Vannes-Angers region of France, and how much the area had probably changed during the years of war. He ran his hand through his thick brown hair and sighed.</p><p><i>Must trust the map. No other choice.</i></p><p>Alone in the foggy, wet darkness, the twenty-six-year-old, tall, slender Alabamian continued his journey toward enemy territory. As he drove, his stomach knotted and burned. Bile rose and stuck in his throat. He swallowed hard but couldn&#x2019;t dislodge it. He clutched the steering wheel tighter with each mile he traveled.</p><p>As he inched forward toward St. P�re-en-Retz, he moved farther away from the Allied-controlled countryside, and closer toward the barbed wire blockade that ushered him into the German-occupied seaport pocket of France. He was thankful for the jeep&#x2019;s canvas top that protected him from the rain&#x2014;a perk granted to him by Malony. He shivered as the west winds blew in from the Atlantic and made the eerie fog twist in surreal shapes across the still dark countryside.</p><p><i>The German lines can&#x2019;t be much farther.</i></p><p>Andy&#x2019;s heart beat faster. He wondered how a German sentry would react to a lone American, wearing Red Cross insignias, driving a jeep sporting a large white flag, appearing ghost-like and unexpected at the opening in the concertina wire fence separating the combatants.</p><p><i>He&#x2019;ll shoot me</i>. <i>That&#x2019;s how he&#x2019;ll respond</i>.</p><p>Before he was ready, he was there. He saw the wire barrier within a few yards of him. He stopped the jeep and sat still, quiet, his eyes closed. In his mind, Andy envisioned the faces of the people he loved, as they would gather later that day around the family&#x2019;s table. He saw his young bride, Mary Louise Shirley, the popular campus beauty who had fallen in love with him&#x2014;Andrew Gerow Hodges, Howard College&#x2019;s rising football star. Number 15.</p><p><i>Mary Louise Shirley&#x2014;beautiful, brilliant, educated, from a good family&#x2014;how did I, a poor country boy from South Alabama, ever get such a fine girl?!</i></p><p>Andy shook his head, smiled, and thought about the baby boy born to them a year after they married&#x2014;Andrew Gerow Hodges, Jr. &#x201c;Little Gerry&#x201d; was almost two years old the summer Andy left Alabama to join the war effort in France.</p><p>The faces of Andy&#x2019;s father and mother appeared next in his mind. He felt unusually thankful for his dad at that moment, a poor horse trader with little or no education, but a loving father who had taught his three sons great lessons in moral ethics, wisdom, honest hard work, and good common horse sense. He thought about his mother, kind, selfless, loving, and dedicated to her boys.</p><p><i>Poor Mom. I wonder if she&#x2019;ll be able to handle emotionally receiving the missing-in-action telegram&#x2014;or something worse&#x2014;that might come before Christmas&#x2014;if I don&#x2019;t make it back from this mission.</i></p><p>For a brief second, a feeling of helplessness overwhelmed him. He&#x2019;d never felt so alone and so far away from those he loved, from those who had always offered him unconditional love and support.</p><p><i>I had a choice. I could&#x2019;ve stayed home. I chose to come and serve.</i></p><p>Andy rubbed his left shoulder. The old college football injury still caused him pain. A teammate&#x2019;s violent blow had ruptured his biceps tendon. But the suffering caused by a damaged deltoid didn&#x2019;t hurt nearly as much as the military&#x2019;s 4-F classification that came as a result of it. Andy was in excellent physical shape&#x2014;a well-built, trim, muscular college athlete. But when the army medics had examined his left shoulder, they declared him unfit for military service. The news was unexpected, shocking, and caused Andy deep grief. He watched his buddies eagerly march off to war, and he agonized over his humiliating 4-F status. Finally he could bear it no longer. He knew the physical injury could keep him out of the United States military, but it could not keep him out of the American Red Cross. If the U.S. Army forbade him to come in the front door with his college friends and other recruits&#x2014;well then, he could just join the American Red Cross and come in through the back door. And that&#x2019;s exactly what he did.</p><p>He had chosen to come, leaving a wife and son, and a good-paying job, so that he could serve alongside his comrades, and help win this war against Hitler. The 94th Army Infantry Division, stationed in France, was glad to have him, gave him the rank of captain, and made him their ARC senior field director. Andy&#x2019;s dedication to duty, dependability, and courage in difficult situations quickly earned the confidence and respect of Malony as well as Bergquist. The commanding officer had given him critical missions he&#x2019;d entrust to no one else. Andy was doing his part, even if a small one, and inside he felt real good about it.</p><p>As Andy faced the wire barrier, he pondered how to proceed. He had witnessed firsthand the depth of German cruelty toward Allied soldiers. He felt the urge to turn the jeep around and go back to headquarters&#x2014;back to the safety of Ch�teaubriant and the 94th Division. But he knew he couldn&#x2019;t. If he&#x2019;d learned anything from his father, it was determination and duty, not backing down when the going gets tough, and doing the best job you can do&#x2014;even if it kills you.</p><p><i>And this trip might do just that.</i></p><p>Checking the security of his ARC collar pins and the Red Cross badge on his left shoulder, he licked his lips, took a deep breath, and somehow found the courage needed to move forward. He had no weapon, no protection&#x2014;other than his wits, a letter, a white flag, and the Red Cross insignias.</p><p><i>I hope it&#x2019;s enough.</i></p><p>Driving slowly to the wire, Hodges stopped abruptly when he saw a surprised German sentry running from the woods, pointing his automatic weapon and screaming: &#x201c;<i>Achtung!</i> <i>Halt!</i> <i>Achtung!</i>&#x201d; [&#x201c;Look out! Stop! Your attention!&#x201d;]</p><p><i>Here it comes.</i> <i>This ballgame may be over.</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>TWO</p><p>THE SPY</p><p>24 August 1944, St. Nazaire Sector, Brittany, France</p><p>Captain Michael R. D. Foot had proved himself a skilled assassin. As a member of Britain&#x2019;s Special Air Service (SAS), whom Hitler called the &#x201c;terror troops,&#x201d; he had participated in many demanding and dangerous missions. This one, however, would be his first foray into German-occupied France. In the summer of &#x2019;44, Britain&#x2019;s SAS commander ordered the young Foot to infiltrate the St. Nazaire sector of Brittany to hunt down a particular vicious German officer.</p><p>&#x201c;A certain German, by the name of Oberleutnant Bonner, in the Sicherheitsdienst [SD], is causing us much trouble. He has been especially cruel to our POWs. Find him. Capture him if you can. If you can&#x2019;t, then kill him,&#x201d; the commander ordered Foot.1</p><p>Michael knew about the Sicherheitsdienst&#x2014;the Nazi Party&#x2019;s intelligence and security body, created by Heinrich Himmler in 1931. He&#x2019;d personally seen the results of their unlimited power&#x2014;given to them by Hitler himself&#x2014;to deal with all opposition to the Nazi government. Foot eagerly accepted the assignment, and parachuted into Normandy, ready and eager to begin his secret mission. On August 22, he secured a jeep, hired a French SAS driver named Caplan, and together they wormed their way along narrow roads and set out to infiltrate enemy lines.</p><p>&#x201c;Make haste, Caplan,&#x201d; Foot ordered his driver. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have much time. Let&#x2019;s get this job done and get out of here.&#x201d;</p><p>Foot and Caplan spoke little as they sped down dirt roads toward St. Nazaire. As Foot saw the countryside pass by, he thought about the long list of military heroes sprinkled throughout his prominent British family&#x2014;his great-great-uncle, the Royal Navy&#x2019;s first sea lord, Jackie Fisher; his paternal grandfather, who had achieved the rank of major general; his father, Brigadier General Richard C. Foot, head of London&#x2019;s air defenses; and himself, an SAS captain. He held his head a little higher. He felt proud&#x2014;of his family, of his father, and of himself. He knew he had a legacy to uphold, and that he could never fail. He&#x2019;d rather die than face embarrassing his distinguished father, or disgracing his celebrated British ancestors. Military failure was not an option for Michael Foot.</p><p>Foot watched closely for German machine gun nests hiding along the roadsides. He had been warned about Jerries crouching and hiding beneath and behind the thick hedgerows that grew in this part of France. He knew the Germans feared the SAS, the elite United Kingdom forces, one of the toughest in the military worldwide. He had heard of the unfortunate fates of SAS members when captured by the enemy, and the fact that few SAS men had ever seen the inside of a German POW prison camp. Most had been shot on sight, no questions asked.</p><p>As Caplan drove in the area near Savenay, the English officer thought about the recently failed Operation Bulbasket<i>&#x2014;</i>a military disaster.2 He remembered that just the month before, a group of SAS members had been captured near Poitiers, France.</p><p><i>That was a bloody mess, a really bad show. Those mucking Jerries. They should all be shot</i> <i>for what they did to those SAS members.</i></p><p>Foot instinctively winced when he envisioned how thirty of these SAS men had been savagely tortured and executed by a German firing squad. He scanned the area around him, feeling an uncharacteristic moment of fear.</p><p><i>If I&#x2019;m captured, I&#x2019;m dead.</i></p><p>Suddenly, without warning, Caplan slammed on the brakes. The jeep&#x2019;s wheels skidded to a stop at the edge of a steep drop-off in the middle of the road.</p><p>With his right hand, Foot grabbed hold of the windshield to keep from falling out.</p><p>&#x201c;Caplan! What the blazing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The bridge! Sir, the bridge across the canal is gone!&#x201d; Caplan shouted. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re lucky we didn&#x2019;t go over!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go around another way, mate!&#x201d; Foot ordered, straightening himself in his seat and checking his wristwatch.</p><p>&#x201c;Sir, there is no other way. We&#x2019;ll have to go back. I&#x2019;ll turn the jeep around. It might take a moment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do what you must!&#x201d; Foot scowled. &#x201c;Just chivvy on and hurry it up!&#x201d;</p><p>Foot climbed out and stretched his long legs.

What could be more exciting? This new story features all the hallmarks that readers love about the Angelina books: fluffy dresses, beautiful princesses, a sparkling cover, and, of course, ballet! Timeless and utterly charming.</p><p>Katharine Holabird&#x2019;s first Angelina Ballerina book was published in 1983. After graduating from the Francis Parker School in Chicago, Katharine attended Bennington College in Vermont. She received a B.A. in Literature from Bennington in 1969, and then worked as a literary editor at the college for a year. The following year she went to Italy, where she became a freelance journalist. In 1974, Katharine married and moved with her husband, Michael Haggiag, to London, England where she lives today with her family.Angelina practices her ballet walk and curtsy in preparation for serving as a bridesmaid in Princess Eliza&#39;s wedding. Dressed for the ceremony, she and Princess Sophie venture out to explore the gardens and become trapped in a ruined tower, but Angelina&#39;s cousin Henry saves the day. Lovers of the Angelina Ballerina books will find plenty to enjoy here, from the familiar mouse characters to the richly detailed illustrations to the idea of being in a royal wedding. The story has drama as well as childlike details, while Craig&#39;s sensitive ink-and-watercolor illustrations are inviting and, in one case, entrancing.

This statement, criticizing the U.S. government's failure to pursue international peace or address domestic inequality, became the organization's manifesto. Its last convention was held in 1969 in Chicago, where, collapsing under the weight of its notoriety and popularity, it shattered into myriad factions. Through brilliant art and they were-there dialogue, famed graphic novelist Harvey Pekar, gifted artist Gary Dumm, and renowned historian Paul Buhle illustrate the tumultuous decade that first defined and then was defined by the men and women who gathered under the SDS banner. <i>Students for a Democratic Society: A Graphic History</i> captures the idealism and activism that drove a generation of young Americans to believe that even one person's actions can help transform the world.</p></p><p><p><b>Harvey Pekar </b>is best known for his graphic autobiography, <i>American Splendor</i>, on which comic artist <b>Gary Dumm</b> collaborated. <b>Paul Buhle</b>, a senior lecturer at Brown University, was founding editor of the SDS journal <i>Radical America</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Students for a Democratic Society: A Graphic History</i> will make old timers remember, discuss, argue and laugh, while the young will bubble with questions.

In <i>The Gourmands&#x2019; Way</i>, Justin Spring tells the story of six American writer-adventurers having the time of their lives in the City of Light during this period and, in doing so, transforming the way Americans talk and think about food&#x2015;and the way they eat.</p><p>The six are A.

Sweat was for less sensitive men, the near-animals who made their nails and wove their endless cloth and tended their machinery in the factories that pumped the air out of the sky and replaced it with foul coal smoke.<br>This was not the first day John had left early. Many times, pushing another man&#x2019;s broom in another man&#x2019;s store, he had become impatient and taken his box of paints and pens and coals, and a sheaf of papers, and headed out of the city, beyond Broughton to the north or Ardwick to the east, to where the scenes were rustic and unspoiled, to where the carriages did not come.<br>There was no grace in carriages, or in any of the works of men, John was sure. To him all buildings were blocky protuberances from the surface of the earth; Manchester was a vast blemish. He could not paint with a carriage in the scene; the thought of drawing a shop or factory would never have occurred to him. Instead he had always painted the gentle, wild scenes by the River Medlock, upstream of Manchester where the water was drinkable and fish had strength to leap.<br>But now he had painted everything within a day&#x2019;s going and coming of Manchester. Even if he had not, he had no will to paint anything near this city, even if he saw something new. Tied to the shop by his need for money, where the work dulled him and slowed his mind and heart, he could not paint his best. True, the painters in London were forced to paint portraits, dull visions of dull people, in order to finance themselves in style. But at least they painted for their bread and were received as artists in society, not forced to bear the crude manners of factory men, not forced to smile and deferently give them what they wanted for their coins, their precious and grudgingly given pennies and shillings. A real painter never had fingers so stiff from gripping a broom that he could not hold a brush.<br>So today John left work early, but did not go to the countryside. Instead he headed home.<br>Home was surely not where he had intended to go. He had meant to go east, keep walking until he reached London, where a discriminating audience would soon recognize his talent. But, as always, his feet would not let him leave Anna, not without seeing her one last time. He tried to remember--hadn&#x2019;t he felt this way before? Hadn&#x2019;t he meant to leave, and then changed his mind because of Anna&#x2019;s comfortable ways?<br>Busy people passed him, hurrying, shoving sometimes, jostling and scrambling for place in the dirty streets. John refused to let his heart beat as quickly as theirs. His footsteps were slower. More relaxed. He could hear the silent criticisms as the busy men went by. Idler. Slacker. If you have no hurry, don&#x2019;t take place on the road. But I am not on the road, John answered. I am walking in the meadow God meant this place to be. You have hidden it in stone, but still my feet can feel the grass, my ears can hear the bees dozing on the dandelions.<br>Home was one apartment in a long building that stretched the length of a block of Bedford Street. It was a nice enough place, their cottage, but definitely middle class. Definitely middle-bordering-on-lower class. Not the home of a gentleman. I was meant to be a gentleman, John Kirkham thought bitterly. If the universe were properly run I would manage a great estate and paint in the garden in the afternoon. God is perfect when it comes to nature, but he&#x2019;s far too whimsical with the lives of men. Bees don&#x2019;t dig badger holes, yet I take small money and wait on barbarians. I have been mislaid in a world of brick. If my father had had the good sense to be as impotent as he was stupid, I might have had my soul placed in a different family, with the right advantages. The stone walls of the great houses in the countryside. Some men should not have had children.<br>&#x201c;Father.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dinah. Your cheek is dirty. Your mother ought to wash you more.&#x201d;<br>His ten-year-old daughter looked up at him with her inscrutable face. She neither smiled nor frowned nor anything at all. Like a cat, her eyes just stared into his face, as if she knew what lay behind his eyes. He felt a rush of guilt, knowing that he had decided to leave. Damn this girl for her silence, for her seeing eyes.<br>&#x201c;Enough of that,&#x201c; he said to her. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s for supper?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t ready yet.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course it isn&#x2019;t, girl; I&#x2019;m home early, do you think I don&#x2019;t know that?&#x201d; He was ashamed to be annoyed, yet could not curb either the annoyance or the shame. &#x201c;Why aren&#x2019;t you in school?&#x201d;<br>She said nothing, only looked at him. Of course he remembered why. The girls were sent home earlier than the boys. But she could make a civil answer, couldn&#x2019;t she? He wanted to shake her. Answer me, damn you. What are you thinking? Speak, child, or I&#x2019;ll know the devil&#x2019;s in you. But he knew from experience that nothing would get words from this child unless she felt the need to speak. Her school uniform was frayed, faded, and too small. Not my fault. It was my father who gambled it all away. It&#x2019;s not my fault for my father&#x2019;s sins.<br>He brushed past his lithe daughter and entered the cottage. Onions were strong in the air. That meant no meat tonight, so there were onions to give some flavor to the potatoes. The endless potatoes, poor man&#x2019;s food. Filthy Papist Irishman&#x2019;s food. John resented the potatoes without letting himself draw a connection between the low wages he brought home and the hours he spent away from the shop to play with a paintbrush that earned no money.<br>&#x201c;Anna,&#x201c; he said. Anna was surprised to see him home. Well, be surprised if you like, Anna. Life is rude shocks, Anna, and the rudest of all is the shock of learning where you must live your life, and that you may never leave that place. But I will leave.<br>&#x201c;Are you ill, to be home early?&#x201d;<br>He shook his head. &#x201c;Only tired.&#x201d;<br>He ignored the frown on Anna&#x2019;s forehead. Only tired. His own words were an accusation: she was also tired, but where could <em>she</em>go to escape from her work?<br>Charlie came down the stairs, a book under his arm. He was small for seven years old, but bright and eager. Was I bright and eager at seven? John did not think so. He had been a moody child, had grown to be a melancholy man. Brightness was Anna&#x2019;s manner, and Charlie was Anna&#x2019;s boy. &#x201c;Papa, are you ill?&#x201d;<br>Again no. &#x201c;I just couldn&#x2019;t bear the shop any longer, and old Martin couldn&#x2019;t bear me, and so we agreed to part company.&#x201d; He saw Anna&#x2019;s eyes go wide with fear. &#x201c;Only for the afternoon, Anna. I haven&#x2019;t lost my place.&#x201d; He spoke snidely, angrily; how dare she care about his <em>place</em>when she didn&#x2019;t give a damn about his soul. Fine with <em>you</em>if your husband never achieves what he was born to do, just so he brings home money. Never mind how the earning of it ruins him.<br>She clattered the spoons on the table; she was angry that he had spoken so sharply to her. It was unfair, and he was sorry. &#x201c;You should have been the man, Anna,&#x201c; he said mildly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d be rich by now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;d look fine in a fancy gown, John,&#x201c; she said, smiling at him. Again he felt contempt for her, for being so changeable of mood. When <em>he</em>was sad, he stayed quite glum all day; another sign of the weakness of women, that they could not hold a humour.<br>Charlie came to his mother and began reciting. The sound of it throbbed in John&#x2019;s head; he would have left, but his languor sank him deep into the chair and he could not move.<br>* * *<br><em>Know then thyself, presume not God to scan</em>;<br><em>The proper study of mankind is man</em>.<br>* * *<br>Wretched boy. Miserable boy. Your mother&#x2019;s son to the core. Read read read. Recite it once, recite it twice until all the family can say the words along with you. And the boy&#x2019;s worst habit was to get well into a piece he had done a hundred times and then stop, leaving the last few lines to hammer endlessly through his father&#x2019;s head.<br>&#x201c;Born but to die, and reasoning but to err.&#x201d;<br>What sort of miserable stuff is Anna teaching to the boy? Born but to die. Sounds downright Papist. Anna <em>will</em>have the children read, <em>will</em>have them go to school, whatever it costs, however it means that he must do his endless, meaningless toil and be content eating potatoes and onions, so the children can have their books. It&#x2019;s not as if the boy <em>understood</em>any of what he spouted. Ta-DUM ta-DUM ta-DUM ta DUM ta-DUM.<br>* * *<br><em>Created half to rise and half to fall</em>;<br><em>Great lord of all things, yet a prey to all</em>;<br><em>Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurled</em>:<br><em>The glory, jest, and riddle of the world</em>.<br>* * *<br>Just as John was about to cry aloud, about to run from the house begging for silence, for respite from the boy&#x2019;s rote wisdom, just then came Dinah&#x2019;s gentle hand on his forehead, stroking, calming. He did not open his eyes and look at her; did not speak to her, because she would not answer. He just slumped in his chair and let her gentle hands minister to his inward pain. His younger son might be unbearable, but his daughter had a good heart and a knack for kindness. Of course I won&#x2019;t go.<br>H...</p></p><h2>Art &amp; Religion in the 21st Century</h2><p><p><strong>A fresh approach to the connection between art and religion that seeks to redefine their relationship in the contemporary age</strong></p> The relationship between art and religion has been long, complex, and often conflicted, and it has given rise to many of the greatest works in the history of art. Artists today continue to reflect seriously upon religious traditions, themes, and institutions, suggesting a new approach to spirituality that is more considered than confrontational.<br><br><em>Art &amp; Religion in the 21st Century</em> is the first in-depth study to survey an international roster of artists who use their work to explore religion&#x2019;s cultural, social, political, and psychological impact on today&#x2019;s world. An introduction outlines the debates and controversies that the art/religion connection has precipitated throughout history. Each of the book&#x2019;s ten chapters introduces a theme&#x2015;ideas of the Creation, the figure of Jesus, the sublime, wonder, diaspora and exile, religious and political conflict, ritual practice, mourning and monumentalizing, and spiritual &#x201c;dwelling&#x201d; in the body and in space&#x2015;followed by a selection of works of art that illustrates that theme. Artists discussed include Vanessa Beecroft, Maurizio Cattelan, Makoto Fujimura, David LaChapelle, Annette Messager, Jason Rhoades, Andres Serrano, and Zeng Fanzhi. 225 color illustrations</p><p>Dr. Aaron Rosen is Professor of Religious Thought at Rocky Mountain College and Visiting Professor at King&#39;s College London.

Steve Vail has brains, brawn and balls -- and is back for his latest mission. Steve Vail visits Kate Bannon, Assistant Director of the FBI, for a well-earned and romantic New Years Eve in Washington, DC, but he suddenly finds himself knee-deep in a very complicated and unusual case. A man known simply as Calculus, an intelligence officer at the Russian embassy, approaches the FBI claiming he knows of several Americans who are supplying confidential government information to the Russian secret service. In exchange for this list, he asks for $250,000 for each traitor the FBI arrests. But when Calculus is suddenly recalled to Moscow, the Bureau suspects the worst. The Russians have probably captured Calculus, and might have access to his list -- which means they&#39;ll soon track down the informants and murder them. That is, unless the FBI can find them first, but without knowing exactly who is on the list, they must keep the operation quiet. Once again, Vail is their man. He&#39;s the ideal candidate for this kind of stealth recon mission. It soon becomes clear that finding Calculus and his list of traitors isn&#39;t going to be quick or quiet. In fact, it&#39;s going to be downright deadly!</p><p>Noah Boyd is a former FBI agent who spent more than twenty years working some of the bureau&#39;s toughest investigations, including the Green River Killer case and the Highland Park Strangler case (which he&#39;s credited with solving).

He wrestles heavy stones on top of one another to form tall, egg-shaped landmarks known as cairns. He painstakingly covers fallen logs with bright golden bands of Dutch elm leaves&#x2014;a last hurrah for a proud species decimated by disease. He pulverizes white chalk to lay a long, wandering path in the woods that gleams in the moonlight. Works like these are as much about the transience of life as they are about a sense of place and the pleasures of color, light and form. In <i>Passage</i>, the British artist's latest book, he once again provides diary excerpts that chronicle his daily successes and failures. The lush color photographs he takes to document peak moments of the birth, glory and decay of his art are as beautiful as ever. Unlike the other books, however, <i>Passage</i>--which begins in 2000 and darts back and forth over the next few years--is shadowed by a more urgent sense of mortality. Goldworthy's recently deceased father is in his thoughts, and a major project he tackles is the memorial Garden of Stones for the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York. The garden's giant boulders pose many difficulties--finding the right ones, acquiring them, moving them, experimenting with cutting processes and coping with the elderly stonecutter's frequent tantrums. Hollowed out, the stones will be filled with trowels of earth (a ritual recalling burial) and tiny oak saplings, symbolic of life. "The partnership between tree and stone will be stronger for the tree having grown from the stone, rather than being stuck into it," Goldsworthy writes in his straightforward style. (An essay about this project by the historian Simon Schama, previously published in <i>The New Yorker</i>, is one of several pieces by other writers included in the book.) Once again, Goldsworthy succeeds in showing how seemingly simple ideas and actions can deeply engage both natural forces and human emotions. <i>&#x2014;Cathy Curtis</i>Andy Goldsworthy's work is regularly exhibited in Britain, France, the United States, Japan, and elsewhere. Although commissions take him all over the world, the landscape around his home in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, remains at the heart of his work. Goldsworthy's best-selling books for Abrams include <i>A Collaboration with Nature</i>, <i>Time</i>, <i>Stone</i>, <i>Wall</i>, and <i>Wood</i>. Terry Friedman is an architectural historian and former principal keeper of Leeds City Art Gallery and Henry Moore Centre for the Study of Sculpture in Leeds, England. He curated the first major retrospective of Goldsworthy's work, in 1990.</p><h2>Inner Voices: Selected Poems, 1963-2003</h2><p><br>The poems of Pulitzer Prize-winner Richard Howard are noted for their unique dramatic force and for preserving, in their graceful, exquisitely wrought lines, human utterance at its most urbane.

In the landscape of American poetry no other poet, setting up a homestead for himself, has toiled so diligently to breed such a herd: [poems as] creatures whose dam is art and whose sire is art. It's a formidable task, and I can't imagine anyone better equipped for it than Howard, who recently turned 75 and has been publishing poems and essays for more than 40 years . . . The chronological arrangement of [this book] makes clear that Howard's poetry over the years has trended toward the more personal, direct, wryly plain-spoken. He follows a salutary impulse, and I pursued <i>Inner Voices</i> not merely with steady respect but with [a] gratitude, a warmth, a coalescing affection."&#x2014;<b>Brad Leithauser, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>"In the last half-century, no American poet has been more instinctively, elegantly cosmopolitan than Richard Howard . . . Mr. Howard deserves to be known as the greatest <i>litterateur</i> in America . . . For Mr. Howard, poetry [is] a <i>causerie</i> of master spirits across time and space. The majority of the poems in <i>Inner Voices</i> are responses to other poems, other artworks, other lives; when Mr. Howard is not meditating on a Nadar photograph or a Donatello sculpture, he is assuming the voice of John Ruskin, Edith Wharton, or others among the famous dead. No English-language poet since Browning has devoted himself so exclusively to the traditional dramatic monologue . . . Mr. Howard's language [is] always baroque, periphrastic, Jamesian."&#x2014;<b>Adam Kirsch, <i>The New York Sun</i></b><br><br>"Reading these poems does not feel much like reading other contemporary poets; it feels like reading Henry James or Marianne Moore&#x2014;uncompromising stylists who are therefore our most unflinching, most heartbreaking moralists.

Like Browning, Howard chooses artists and art as the personae and subjects of many of his poems; no wonder, perhaps, for a poet who says that one poem he most wishes he had written is Browning's 'My Last Duchess' . . . While he modernly dispenses with rhyme and meter, Howard shapes his poems by other means, retaining the rhythms and swing of intelligent talk and the look of traditional verse on the page. He is as rich and as ever-fresh as Browning, and it wouldn't be at all surprising if, 100 years hence, a poet like him, or like Browning, were to be characterized as 'our era's Richard Howard.'"&#x2014;<b>Ray Olson, <i>Booklist</i> (starred review)</b><br><br>"Drawing on 12 previous volumes (including 1970's Pulitzer-winning <i>Untitled Subjects</i>), this big assortment plays to Howard's strengths&#x2014;above all, to his impersonations and dramatic monologues. Howard's hyperarticulate sentences fit the preoccupations of his sophisticated personae, many of them 19th-century French and English writers and artists. John Ruskin, Henry James, the early photographer Nadar, Proust, and Jane Morris (William's widow) all receive extended embodiments, as do the secretaries and intimates of other great artists. The book includes Howard's anthology hits, among them 'Nicholas of Mardruz' (a biting response to Browning) and 'Infirmities,' in which the aged Walt Whitman critiques the closeted Bram Stoker. His elaborate forms, or 'habitual / disorders,' 'suffice to hold fast to the small / change of small changes,' exploring regrets or assessing the pleasures of the flesh. Howard's later volumes grew more personal (and more successful) in revealing specifically gay male experience.

They had been murdered two nights before by the US-trained El Salvadoran military. News of the killing shocked the American public and set off a decade of debate over Cold War policy in Latin America. The women themselves became symbols and martyrs, shorn of context and background.<br><br>In <i>A Radical Faith</i>, journalist Eileen Markey breathes life back into one of these women, Sister Maura Clarke. Who was this woman in the dirt? What led her to this vicious death so far from home? Maura was raised in a tight-knit Irish immigrant community in Queens, New York, during World War II. She became a missionary as a means to a life outside her small, orderly world and by the 1970s was organizing and marching for liberation alongside the poor of Nicaragua and El Salvador.<br><br>Maura's story offers a window into the evolution of postwar Catholicism: from an inward-looking, protective institution in the 1950s to a community of people grappling with what it meant to live with purpose in a shockingly violent world. At its heart, <i>A Radical Faith</i> is an intimate portrait of one woman's spiritual and political transformation and her courageous devotion to justice.<br></p><p><b>Eileen Markey</b> is an investigative journalist whose work has appeared in the <i>New York Times, New York Magazine, Wall Street Journal, National Catholic Reporter, America, Commonweal,</i> and <i>Killing the Buddha</i>.

Markey is a graduate of Fordham University's urban studies program and Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism."In death, Maryknoll Sister Maura Clarke became known as a symbol of the brutality of El Salvador's pitiless conflict in the 1980s. In this rare and beautiful book, Eileen Markey brings Maura to life. From her childhood in a tightly knit Irish Catholic neighborhood to her departure for Nicaragua in 1959 and subsequent murder in El Salvador, Maura's life became interwoven with the tumultuous history of Cold War Central America. Drawing on personal correspondence and extensive interviews, Markey skillfully evokes the transformation of the Catholic Church during those turbulent decades, crafting a searing testament to the meaning of faith amidst the hard choices imposed by desperate circumstances."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Cynthia Arnson, Director, Latin American Program, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars</b></i></b><br><br>"A Radical Faith brings excitement, tension, and compassion to an overlooked story...Rich details and solid storytelling convey one nun's story of her dedication to God and her fellow humans."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></i></b><br><br>"I've always believed that responsibility, honesty, and faith are the three pillars of a strong character. Sister Maura Clarke, who recognized the humanity in everyone she met-from schoolchildren in the Bronx to farmers in Nicaragua-lived a life that served as a testament to that strength. Eileen Markey's beautifully told narrative reminds us of Maura's courage in the face of brutal dictators and shocking suffering. It's an important story that has been forgotten for too long, and Markey's book returns Maura to her deserved place in history."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Martin Sheen</b></i></b></p><h2>Vic Braden&#39;s Mental Tennis: How to Psych Yourself to a Winning Game</h2><p>Explains how to combine mental techniques and psychological strategies with physical efforts to improve one&#39;s game of tennis</p><p>Whether you are a tennis novice, a beginner ready for competition, a club player with an eye on the tournament trophy, or a professional stuck in a rut, Vic Braden&#39;s Mental Tennis shows you that your mind can be the single best tool to reconstruct your game.

My first thought on waking was to tell my best friend about the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. Tom�s Aguilar was a classmate who devoted his free time and his talent to the invention of wonderfully ingenious contraptions of dubious practicality, like the aerostatic dart or the dynamo spinning top. I pictured us both, equipped with flashlights and compasses, uncovering the mysteries of those bibliographic catacombs. Who better than Tom�s to share my secret? Then, remembering my promise, I decided that circumstances advised me to adopt what in detective novels is termed a different modus operandi. At noon I approached my father to quiz him about the book and about Juli�n Carax-both world famous, I assumed. My plan was to get my hands on his complete works and read them all by the end of the week. To my surprise, I discovered that my father, a natural-born librarian and a walking lexicon of publishers' catalogs and oddities, had never heard of The Shadow of the Wind or Juli�n Carax. Intrigued, he examined the printing history on the back of the title page for clues.</p><p> "It says here that this copy is part of an edition of twenty-five hundred printed in Barcelona by Cabestany Editores, in June 1936."</p><p> "Do you know the publishing house?"</p><p> "It closed down years ago. But, wait, this is not the original. The first edition came out in November 1935 but was printed in Paris....Published by Galiano &amp; Neuval. Doesn't ring a bell."</p><p> "So is this a translation?"</p><p> "It doesn't say so. From what I can see, the text must be the original one."</p><p> "A book in Spanish, first published in France?"</p><p> "It's not that unusual, not in times like these," my father put in. "Perhaps Barcel= can help us...."</p><p> Gustavo Barcel= was an old colleague of my father's who now owned a cavernous establishment on Calle Fernando with a commanding position in the city's secondhand-book trade. Perpetually affixed to his mouth was an unlit pipe that impregnated his person with the aroma of a Persian market. He liked to describe himself as the last romantic, and he was not above claiming that a remote line in his ancestry led directly to Lord Byron himself. As if to prove this connection, Barcel= fashioned his wardrobe in the style of a nineteenth-century dandy. His casual attire consisted of a cravat, white patent leather shoes, and a plain glass monocle that, according to malicious gossip, he did not remove even in the intimacy of the lavatory. Flights of fancy aside, the most significant relative in his lineage was his begetter, an industrialist who had become fabulously wealthy by questionable means at the end of the nineteenth century. According to my father, Gustavo Barcel= was, technically speaking, loaded, and his palatial bookshop was more of a passion than a business. He loved books unreservedly, and-although he denied this categorically-if someone stepped into his bookshop and fell in love with a tome he could not afford, Barcel= would lower its price, or even give it away, if he felt that the buyer was a serious reader and not an accidental browser. Barcel= also boasted an elephantine memory allied to a pedantry that matched his demeanor and the sonority of his voice. If anyone knew about odd books, it was he. That afternoon, after closing the shop, my father suggested that we stroll along to the Els Quatre Gats, a cafT on Calle Montsi=, where Barcel= and his bibliophile knights of the round table gathered to discuss the finer points of decadent poets, dead languages, and neglected, moth-ridden masterpieces. <br></p><p> Els Quatre Gats was just a five-minute walk from our house and one of my favorite haunts. My parents had met there in 1932, and I attributed my one-way ticket into this world in part to the old cafT's charms. Stone dragons guarded a lamplit fatade anchored in shadows. Inside, voices seemed shaded by the echoes of other times. Accountants, dreamers, and would-be geniuses shared tables with the specters of Pablo Picasso, Isaac AlbTniz, Federico Garcfa Lorca, and Salvador Dalf. There any poor devil could pass for a historical figure for the price of a small coffee.</p><p> "Sempere, old man," proclaimed Barcel= when he saw my father come in. "Hail the prodigal son. To what do we owe the honor?"</p><p> "You owe the honor to my son, Daniel, Don Gustavo. He's just made a discovery."</p><p> "Well, then, pray come and sit down with us, for we must celebrate this ephemeral event," he announced.</p><p> "Ephemeral?" I whispered to my father.</p><p> "Barcel= can express himself only in frilly words," my father whispered back. "Don't say anything, or he'll get carried away."</p><p> The lesser members of the coterie made room for us in their circle, and Barcel=, who enjoyed flaunting his generosity in public, insisted on treating us.</p><p> "How old is the lad?" inquired Barcel=, inspecting me out of the corner of his eye.</p><p> "Almost eleven," I announced.</p><p> Barcel= flashed a sly smile.</p><p> "In other words, ten. Don't add on any years, you rascal. Life will see to that without your help."</p><p> A few of his chums grumbled in assent. Barcel= signaled to a waiter of such remarkable decrepitude that he looked as if he should be declared a national landmark.</p><p> "A cognac for my friend Sempere, from the good bottle, and a cinnamon milk shake for the young one-he's a growing boy. Ah, and bring us some bits of ham, but spare us the delicacies you brought us earlier, eh? If we fancy rubber, we'll call for Pirelli tires."</p><p> The waiter nodded and left, dragging his feet.</p><p> "I hate to bring up the subject," Barcel= said, "but how can there be jobs? In this country nobody ever retires, not even after they're dead. Just look at El Cid. I tell you, we're a hopeless case."</p><p> He sucked on his cold pipe, eyes already scanning the book in my hands. Despite his pretentious fatade and his verbosity, Barcel= could smell good prey the way a wolf scents blood.</p><p> "Let me see," he said, feigning disinterest. "What have we here?"</p><p> I glanced at my father. He nodded approvingly. Without further ado, I handed Barcel= the book. The bookseller greeted it with expert hands. His pianist's fingers quickly explored its texture, consistency, and condition. He located the page with the publication and printer's notices and studied it with Holmesian flair. The rest watched in silence, as if awaiting a miracle, or permission to breathe again.</p><p> "Carax. Interesting," he murmured in an inscrutable tone.</p><p> I held out my hand to recover the book. Barcel= arched his eyebrows but gave it back with an icy smile.</p><p> "Where did you find it, young man?"</p><p> "It's a secret," I answered, knowing that my father would be smiling to himself. Barcel= frowned and looked at my father. "Sempere, my dearest old friend, because it's you and because of the high esteem I hold you in, and in honor of the long and profound friendship that unites us like brothers, let's call it at forty duros, end of story."</p><p> "You'll have to discuss that with my son," my father pointed out. "The book is his."</p><p> Barcel= granted me a wolfish smile. "What do you say, laddie? Forty duros isn't bad for a first sale....Sempere, this boy of yours will make a name for himself in the business."</p><p> The choir cheered his remark. Barcel= gave me a triumphant look and pulled out his leather wallet. He ceremoniously counted out two hundred pesetas, which in those days was quite a fortune, and handed them to me. But I just shook my head. Barcel= scowled.</p><p> "Dear boy, greed is most certainly an ugly, not to say mortal, sin. Be sensible. Call me crazy, but I'll raise that to sixty duros, and you can open a retirement fund. At your age you must start thinking of the future."</p><p> I shook my head again. Barcel= shot a poisonous look at my father through his monocle.</p><p> "Don't look at me," said my father. "I'm only here as an escort."</p><p> Barcel= sighed and peered at me closely.</p><p> "Let's see, junior. <i>What</i> is it you want?"</p><p> "What I want is to know who Juli�n Carax is and where I can find other books he's written."</p><p> Barcel= chuckled and pocketed his wallet, reconsidering his adversary.</p><p> "Goodness, a scholar. Sempere, what do you feed the boy?"</p><p> The bookseller leaned toward me confidentially, and for a second I thought he betrayed a look of respect that had not been there a few moments earlier.</p><p> "We'll make a deal," he said. "Tomorrow, Sunday, in the afternoon, drop by the Ateneo library and ask for me. Bring your precious find with you so that I can examine it properly, and I'll tell you what I know about Juli�n Carax. Quid pro quo."</p><p> "Quid pro what?"</p><p> "Latin, young man. There's no such thing as dead languages, only dormant minds. Paraphrasing, it means that you can't get something for nothing, but since I like you, I'm going to do you a favor."</p><p> The man's oratory could kill flies in midair, but I suspected that if I wanted to find out anything about Juli�n Carax, I'd be well advised to stay on good terms with him. I proffered my most saintly smile in delight at his Latin outpourings.</p><p> "Remember, tomorrow, in the Ateneo," pronounced the bookseller. "But bring the book, or there's no deal."</p><p> "Fine."</p><p> Our conversation slowly merged into the murmuring of the other members of the coffee set. The discussion turned to some documents found in the basement of El Escorial that hinted at the possibility that Don Miguel de Cervantes had in fact been the nom de plume of a large, hairy lady of letters from Toledo. Barcel= seemed distracted, not tempted to claim a share in the debate. He remained quiet, observing me from his fake monocle with a masked smile. Or perhaps he was only looking at the book I held in my hands.</p><p> --from <i>The Shadow of the Wind</i> by Carlos Ruiz Safon, Copyright � 2004 Carlos Ruiz Safon, published by The Penguin Press, a member of Penguin Group (USA) Inc., all rights reserved, reprinted with permission from the publisher."<br><br></p></p><h2>The New Age Cult</h2><p>From the founder and director of the Christian Research Institute.<p></p><p>Know across the United States as radio's "The Bible Answer Man" and the bestselling author of <i>The Kingdom of the Cults</i>, Dr. Walter Martin is firmly established as a true apologist for the Christian faith.

For a farm to be certified organic, the seed also has to be designated as such, but it&#x2019;s not just those seeking or holding certifications who are leaning toward using this kind of seed. Gardeners, hobby farmers, community garden managers, and others are driving demand, particularly for heirloom vegetable varieties. Although there are several commercial companies that offer organic seed for sale, smaller growers and hobbyists are finding enjoyment and affordability in 'seed saving' for themselves. In this valuable, highly detailed exploration of the topic, John Navazio takes readers through the steps necessary to produce an organic seed crop, with best practices, a primer on crop plant biology, and tips on seed storage. Navazio is well-versed in the topic as the senior scientist for the Organic Seed Alliance and a plant breeding and seed specialist for Washington State University Extension. Insightful and experienced, Navazio provides information in a straightforward, easy-to-follow manner. After a fascinating stroll through the history of agricultural seed, he then covers vegetable families&#x2015;such as alliaceae, brassicaceae, and cucurbitaceae&#x2015;and their characteristics before delving into the details of particular vegetables, like leeks or lettuce. Even for those who don&#x2019;t plan on seed saving, these chapters are stunning in their straightforward presentation of complex material, including soil and fertility requirements, growing methods, harvest, and genetic maintenance. As a farmer might say, every description is nutritionally dense. Although the guide is most relevant to farmers who might want to sell seeds as part of a diversified small-farm operation, Navazio&#x2019;s expertise will likely be fascinating to the backyard gardener as well.

Though the book is thick, dense, and unfriendly to careless readers, it is indispensable to those interested in the philosophy of consciousness and free will. Some of his arguments are fallacious, others are unclear, but for the most part Sartre's thoughts penetrate deeply into fundamental philosophical territory. Basing his conception of self-consciousness loosely on Heidegger's "being," Sartre proceeds to sharply delineate between conscious actions ("for themselves") and unconscious ("in themselves"). It is a conscious choice, he claims, to live one's life "authentically" and in a unified fashion, or not--this is the fundamental freedom of our lives.<p> Drawing on history and his own rich imagination for examples, Sartre offers compelling supplements to his more formal arguments. The waiter who detaches himself from his job-role sticks in the reader's memory with greater tenacity than the lengthy discussion of inauthentic life and serves to bring the full force of the argument to life. Even if you're not an angst-addicted poet from North Beach, <i>Being and Nothingness</i> offers you a deep conversation with a brilliant mind--unfortunately, a rare find these days. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><strong>Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-80).</strong> The foremost French thinker and writer of the early post-war years.

At Lake Balaton the 1 SS Panzer Corps waded into vastly superior Red Army forces in what became the last German offensive of the war.On both fronts the panzers were finally overwhelmed and the victors exulted in the annihilation of Nazi Germany. By examining in thorough detail the final death throes of Hitler's elite combat formations, Reynolds vividly illustrates the price of Allied victory, and why it was so difficult to achieve.

At the center of it all stands Donald J. Trump, leading a historic revolt against his own party, &#x201c;bloviating and farting his way&#x201d; through the campaign, &#x201c;saying outrageous things, acting like Hitler one minute and Andrew Dice Clay the next.&#x201d; For Taibbi, the stunning rise of Trump marks the apotheosis of the new postfactual movement.<br><br> Taibbi frames the reporting with original essays that explore the seismic shift in how we perceive our national institutions, the democratic process, and the future of the country. <i>Insane Clown President</i> is not just a postmortem on the collapse and failure of American democracy. It offers the riveting, surreal, unique, and essential experience of seeing the future in hindsight.<br><br><b>&#x201c;Scathing . . . What keeps the pages turning in this so freshly familiar story line is the vivid observation and original turns of phrase.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;San Francisco Chronicle</i></b></p><p><b>Matt Taibbi</b>, author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>The Divide</i>, <i>Griftopia</i>, and <i>The Great Derangement,</i> is a contributing editor for <i>Rolling Stone</i> and winner of the 2008 National Magazine Award for columns and commentary.Chapter 1<br><br>The Great Derangement Redux<br><br>Ten years before Donald Trump, I wrote a book about Middle America&#x2019;s growing mistrust of government, the media and other mainstream forces. The thesis of the book was that we were moving toward a future in which facts would be increasingly irrelevant and people would gravitate more and more toward conspiratorial politics. This situation was fueled by the repeated failures of once-trusted institutions to respond to the frustrations of ordinary people.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t exactly see Donald Trump coming. But there were a lot of signs that the conditions were set long ago for the rise of a truly postfactual candidate.<br><br>From the introduction to The Great Derangement:<br><br>We were living through the last stage of the American empire. Historians consistently describe similar phenomena in past centuries. Great societies often collapse in the same way.<br><br>When the Bolsheviks finally broke through the gates of the Winter Palace, they discovered tsarists inside obsessed with tarot cards. When the barbarians finally stormed Rome in its last days, they found the upper class paralyzed by lethargy and inaction and addicted to the ramblings of fortune-tellers.<br><br>This, too, seemed to be the fate of America, viciously attacked by a serious enemy on 9/11 but unable to grasp the significance of this attack. Most of the country instead fled for consolation to the various corners of our vast media landscape, in particular seeking solace in the Internet, an escapist paradise for the informationally overwhelmed.<br><br>Trained for decades to be little more than good consumers, we had become a nation of reality shoppers, mixing and matching news items to fit our own self-created identities. We rejoiced in the idea that reality was not an absolute but a choice, something we select to fit our own conception not of the world but of ourselves. We are Christians, therefore all world events have a Christian explanation. We hate George Bush, therefore Bush is the cause of it all.<br><br>And directly feeding into this madness was the actual, real failure of our own governmental system, reflected in a chilling new electoral trend. After two consecutive bitterly negative presidential elections and many years of what was turning into a highly deflating military adventure in Iraq, the American public had reached new levels of disgust with the very concept of elections.<br><br>People no longer voted for candidates they liked or were excited by. They voted against candidates they hated. At protests and marches, the ruling emotions were disgust and rage. The lack of idealism, and especially the lack of any sense of brotherhood or common purpose with the other side (i.e., liberals and conservatives unable to imagine a productive future with each other, or even to see themselves as citizens of the same country), was striking.<br><br>Politicians, with their automated speeches and canned blather about &#x201c;hope&#x201d; and &#x201c;change&#x201d; and &#x201c;taking the country back,&#x201d; were now not only not believed by most ordinary people, but actively despised.<br><br>A parallel phenomenon was a growing lack of faith in the mainstream media on both sides of the spectrum. Conservatives and liberals alike accepted unquestioningly the proposition that the stories put out by network news broadcasts and major daily newspapers amounted to little more than a stream of untrammeled, insidious deceptions.<br><br>In the 2006 senatorial primary contest between the would-be Jimmy Stewart&#x2013;esque do-gooder millionaire Ned Lamont and the archetypal Washington whore Joe Lieberman, the fault lines were outlined with crystal clarity.<br><br>The &#x201c;People&#x201d; boosted Lamont with blogs and YouTube broadcasts, while the entrenched political mainstream circled the wagons around Lieberman. The major news mags and dailies blasted the blogger phenomenon, and the likes of sanctimonious New York Times columnist David Brooks ascribed the antimedia bias to &#x201c;moral manias&#x201d; and a &#x201c;Liberal Inquisition.&#x201d;<br><br>On the right, similar fault lines were appearing. Whereas before conservative anger toward the &#x201c;liberal media&#x201d; had been usefully directed against the Democratic Party by Republican strategists, the failure of the Iraq war and also growing disillusionment on the part of Christians who had supported George W. Bush led more and more of those voters to seek out their own enthusiasms.<br><br>For the first time I started to see and hear people at Republican events who sounded very much like the dissidents on the fringes of American liberalism. The Ron Paul supporters who began to collect around the rallies of assembly-line establishment-blowhard candidates like Mitt Romney were almost indistinguishable from the followers of liberal candidates like Dennis Kucinich.<br><br>They were similarly against the war, similarly against the conspiracy of business interests that dominated Washington, similarly fed up with standard-issue campaign stumpery.<br><br>At these events I heard some of the same theories about &#x201c;peak oil&#x201d; and the nefarious influence of institutions like the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission that dominated 9/11 Truth rallies.<br><br>But they weren&#x2019;t liberals. They were ex-Dittoheads and dropouts from the Republican revolution. The Ron Paul candidacy was an extreme example of outsider politics on the left and right merging.<br><br>I spent time down in Texas with a group of churchgoers who were loyal to an apocalyptic theory of world events, one in which 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq were part of an ongoing march toward a final battle between the forces of Satan and an army of God.<br><br>At the same time, I found myself involved, at times involuntarily, with the 9/11 Truth Movement.<br><br>The similarities between both of these groups is striking and should be clear to anyone who reads this book. Both groups were and are defined primarily by an unshakable belief in the inhumanity of their enemies on the other side.<br><br>The Christians seldom distinguished between Islamic terrorism and, say, Al Gore&#x2013;style environmentalism. The Truthers easily believed that reporters for the Washington Post, the president, and the front-line operators of NORAD were equally capable of murdering masses of ordinary New York financial-sector employees.<br><br>Abandoned by the political center, both groups ascribed unblinkingly to a militant, us-against-them worldview, where only their own could be trusted.<br><br>What made them distinctly American was that, while actually the victims of an obvious, unhidden conspiracy of corrupt political power, they chose to battle bugbears that were completely idiotic, fanciful, and imaginary.<br><br>At a time when the country desperately needed its citizens to man up and seize control of their common destiny, they instead crawled into alleys and feverishly jacked themselves off in frenzies of panicked narcissism.<br><br>Time and again during the research for this book, I encountered people who acted not like engaged citizens looking for solutions to real problems, but like frightened adolescents, unaccustomed to the burdens of political power. People saw in the vacuum of governmental competence an opportunity not to take control of their lives, but to step in and replace the buffoons above with buffoon acts of their own.<br><br>They made elaborate speeches to no one in particular, as though cameras were on them, they dressed in Washington and Jefferson costumes, they primped and preened like they were revolutionaries, modern-day Patrick Henrys and Thomas Paines. And they got nothing done.<br><br>I was struck particularly by a meeting of 9/11 Truthers in Austin, Texas, in which a &#x201c;discussion&#x201d; of what to do about the conspiracy in Washington devolved into a speech-making session. A group of twenty-five to thirty Truthers filed into a little church on the outskirts of town and, led by a breezy, EST-counselorish moderator who enforced tolerance for the viewpoints of all, each participant got up and offered his or her own individual angry theory about the nature of The Conspiracy.<br><br>Some blamed the royals, others the bankers, others the Trilateral Commission, all blamed decades of Bush family iniquity, and one woman even talked about a conspiracy to hide the discovery of alien technologies at Area 51.<br><br>Everyone made his or her speech, and then the meeting was over with nothing accomplished except a decision to have another meeting.<br><br>Having seen all this, what I ended up trying to do in this book was describe the whole outline of the problem. Much of the book focuses on the insider game in Washington, from the corrupt response to Hurricane Katrina to both parties&#x2019; absurdly transparent attempts to deflect popular opposition to the Iraq war. At the same time I tried to describe the response to this nonfunctioning government across the country, on both the right and the left.<br><br>What I hope comes through is that the corruption of the system certainly has had consequences in the population, inspiring popular disgust and rage, with voters keenly understanding on some level anyway the depth of their betrayal.<br><br>But the form of the public response turns out to be a grotesquerie. It turns out that we&#x2019;ve been split up and atomized for so long that real grassroots politics isn&#x2019;t really possible.<br><br>We don&#x2019;t respond to problems as communities, but as demographics. In the same way that we shop for cars and choose television programs, we pick our means of political protest. We scan the media landscape for the thing that appeals to us and we buy into it.<br><br>That it&#x2019;s the same media landscape these new dissidents often reject as a false and misleading tableau dominated by corrupt interests turns out not to be problematic for many.<br><br>In some cases, like that of those Christians I spent time with in San Antonio, the trusted new figure, a preacher named John Hagee, turns out to be every bit the establishment Washington insider these would-be religious revolutionaries think they&#x2019;re fleeing from.<br><br>In other cases, like that of the 9/11 Truthers, the radical canonical revolutionary tracts end up including thoroughly commercial mainstream entertainments like V for Vendetta and The Matrix (at different times I would hear both radical conservatives and liberals describe their political awakenings using the phrase &#x201c;taking the red pill&#x201d;).<br><br>In short, what sounds on the surface like radical politics turns out to be just another fracturing of the media picture, one that ultimately will result in new groups of captive audiences that, if experience is any guide, will ultimately be assimilated and electorally coddled by a political mainstream in reality bent on ignoring both sides.<br><br>For now, however, the situation going into the 2008 election looks grim. We have a population more disgusted than ever with our political system, one inclined to distrust the result no matter who wins the White House&#x2014;and should the national election end up being a contest between a pair of full-of-shit establishment conservatives like Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani, it will only confirm the worst fears of both sides and result in an even further bonkerization of the population.<br><br>Gone will be the good old days of neat blue-state/red-state hatred&#x2014;a nicely symmetrical storyline that has always appealed to the Crossfire/American Gladiators sports-coverage mentality of the commercial media.<br><br>In its place, at least temporarily, will be a chaos of lunatic enthusiasms and dead-end political movements, with calls for invasions of Babylon and, on the other side, congressional investigations into nonexistent conspiracies . . . <br><br>When a people can no longer agree even on the basic objective facts of their political existence, the equation changes. Real decisions, even in the approximate direction of righteousness, eventually become impossible.<br><br>The Great Derangement is about a stage of our history where politics has seemingly stopped being about ideology, and has instead turned into a problem of information.<br><br>Are the right messages reaching our collective brain? Are the halves of that brain even connected? Do we know who we are anymore? Are we sane? It&#x2019;s a hell of a problem for a nuclear power.<br><br>From Chapter One:<br><br>Out There, in states both blue and red, the People were boarding the mothership, preparing to leave this planet for good.<br><br>The media had long ignored the implications of polls that showed that half the country believed in angels and the inerrancy of the Bible, or of the fact that the Left Behind series of books had sold in the tens of millions.<br><br>But on the ground the political consequences of magical thinking were becoming clearer.<br><br>The religious right increasingly saw satanic influences and signs of the upcoming apocalypse. Meanwhile, on the left, a different sort of fantasy was gaining traction, as an increasing number&#x2014;up to a third of the country according to some polls&#x2014;saw the &#x201c;Bush crime family&#x201d; in league with Al-Qaeda, masterminding 9/11.<br><br>Media outlets largely ignored poll results that they felt could not possibly be true. For instance, there was a CBS News survey that showed that only 16 percent believed that the Bush administration was telling the truth about 9/11, with 53 percent believing the government was &#x201c;hiding something,&#x201d; and another 28 percent believing that it was &#x201c;mostly lying.&#x201d;<br><br>Then there was a stunning Zogby poll taken just in advance of the 2004 Republican convention that showed that nearly half of New York City residents&#x2014;49.3 percent&#x2014;believed that the government knew in advance that the 9/11 attacks were coming and purposely failed to act.<br><br>Voters didn&#x2019;t just distrust the government&#x2019;s words and actions. By 2007 they also had very serious doubts about their government&#x2019;s legitimacy.<br><br>Successive election cycles foundering on voting-machine scandals had left both sides deeply suspicious of election results. A poll in Florida taken in 2004 suggested that some 25 percent of voters worried that their votes were not being counted&#x2014;a 20 percent jump from the pre-2000 numbers.<br><br>Even more damning was a Zogby poll conducted in 2006 that showed only 45 percent of Americans were &#x201c;very confident&#x201d; that George Bush won the 2004 election &#x201c;fair and square.&#x201d;<br><br>The most surprising thing about that last poll was the degree to which the distrust was spread wide across the demographic spectrum. That 71 percent of African Americans distrusted the 2004 results was perhaps not a surprise, given that black voters in America have been victims of organized disenfranchisement throughout this country&#x2019;s history.<br><br>But 28 percent of NASCAR fans? Twenty-five percent of born-again Christians? Thirty-two percent of currently serving members of the armed forces?<br><br>These are astonishing numbers for a country that even in its lowest times&#x2014;after Watergate, say, or during Reconstruction&#x2014;never doubted the legitimacy of their leaders to such a degree.<br><br>And if distrust of the government was at an all-time high, that was still nothing compared to what the public thought of the national media. Both the left and the right had developed parallel theories about the co-opting of the corporate press, imagining it to be controlled by powerful unseen enemies, and increasingly turned to grassroots Internet sources for news and information.<br><br>In the BBC/Reuters/Media Center&#x2019;s annual Trust in the Media survey in 2006, the United States was one of just two countries surveyed&#x2014;Britain being the other&#x2014;where respondents trusted their government (67 percent) more than they trusted national news reporters (59 percent). A Harris poll that same year showed that some 68 percent of Americans now felt that the news media were &#x201c;too powerful.&#x201d;<br><br>The country, in other words, was losing it. Our national politics was doomed...</p><h2>Pet of the Met (Picture Puffins)</h2><p>A mouse who works as a page turner at the Metropolitan Opera House has only one enemy, a cat; but, during a performance of &#34;The Magic Flute,&#34; something magical happens to change their lives.</p><p>Don Freeman was born in San Diego, California, in 1908. At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br> <br> Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Herald Tribune</i>. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br> <br> He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br> <br> Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br> <br> Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including <i>Corduroy</i>, <i>A Pocket for Corduroy</i>, and the Caldecott Honor Book <i>Fly High, Fly Low</i>.</p><h2>Our Souls at Night [Paperback] [May 04, 2016] Kent Haruf</h2><p>Our Souls at Night</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of June 2015:</strong> Elderly widow Addie Moore pays a visit to her aging widower neighbor, Louis Waters. They were never close, just knew each other peripherally, which makes the reason for this social call all the more intriguing. Addie would like to know if Louis is interested in sleeping with her. Now, now, this scenario was conceived by the late, great Kent Haruf&#x2014;<em>Our Souls at Night</em> is no <em>50 Shades of Geriatric Grey</em>. Set in the same fictional Colorado town as his National Book Award-nominated <em>Plainsong</em>, a town with its fair share of gossips, Addie and Louis embark on an unlikely friendship, an antidote to the loneliness they most exquisitely felt at night. As this friendship deepens, it is tested by said busybodies and meddling family members, plot points that almost distract from what makes this novel such a fitting and sweet swan song. <em>Our Souls at Night</em> was inspired, in part, by Haruf&#x2019;s own marriage and the intimate, late-night conversations he and his wife relished, just like Addie and Louis. And just like Addie and Louis, Haruf proved that you&#x2019;re never too old to reinvent yourself, take risks, find love, and write a great novel. <em>--Erin Kodicek</em></p>Kent Haruf&#39;s The Tie That Binds received a Whiting Foundation Award and a special citation from the PEN/Hemingway Foundation.

Searle was "among the reprieved" and his visual diary survived, now published here for the first time. With ironic, surprisingly lighthearted commentary, he documents Singapore's fall with depictions of torture and executions, the slave-built Siam-Burma railroad where two-thirds of Searle's group died, the horror of insect-ridden jungle laborers beaten to amuse the guards and the eventual return of 5000 men to a Changi prison built for 600.

Olson Nature Writing Award</b><b><br></b><br>When a teaspoon of soil contains millions of species, and when we pave over the earth on a daily basis, what does that mean for our future? What is the risk to our food supply, the planet's wildlife, the soil on which every life-form depends? How much undeveloped, untrodden ground do we even have left?<br><br>Paul Bogard set out to answer these questions in <em>The Ground Beneath Us</em>, and what he discovered is astounding.<br><br>From New York (where more than 118,000,000 tons of human development rest on top of Manhattan Island) to Mexico City (which sinks inches each year into the Aztec ruins beneath it), Bogard shows us the weight of our cities' footprints. And as we see hallowed ground coughing up bullets at a Civil War battlefield; long-hidden remains emerging from below the sites of concentration camps; the dangerous, alluring power of fracking; the fragility of the giant redwoods, our planet's oldest living things; the surprises hidden under a Major League ballpark's grass; and the sublime beauty of our few remaining wildest places, one truth becomes blazingly clear: <strong>The ground is the easiest resource to forget, and the last we should</strong>.<br><br>Bogard's <em>The Ground Beneath Us</em> is deeply transporting reading that introduces farmers, geologists, ecologists, cartographers, and others in a quest to understand the importance of something too many of us take for granted: dirt. From growth and life to death and loss, and from the subsurface technologies that run our cities to the dwindling number of idyllic Edens that remain, this is the fascinating story of the ground beneath our feet.</p><p>Paul Bogard is the author of <em>The End of Night</em> and the editor of the anthology <em>Let There Be Night: Testimony on Behalf of the Dark</em>. His writing and commentary on the natural world have appeared in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> and on <em>Slate, Salon</em> and <em>All Things Considered</em>.

Examining urban areas such as New York City, he looks at "what's gone missing, what remains, what may come to be." The soil is "a trove of biodiversity" that we have yet to fully explore, and Bogard chats with an array of experts to learn how to dig deeper."<br><br>&#x2015;<b><i><em>Publishers Weekly</em></i></b><br><br>"A whopper of a cautionary tale... Beyond ecological concerns, Bogard asserts that pavement disconnects us from nature, making the land seem homogeneous and undermining our well-being. The fragility of the life-giving earth we call dirt is the fragility of us all."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Booklist</em></i></b><br><br>"Bogard reminds us of the riches underfoot, from New York's Central Park soil biome, which teems with thousands of freshly discovered species, to terrestrial pitstops that keep migrating birds on the wing."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Nature</em></i></b><br><br>"With lively and deeply personal prose, Bogard unlocks the secret world of earth itself: from the startling biodiversity of soil, to hallowed sites like Gettysburg and New York's World Trade Center, to all that is sacred and profane we ask the ground to hold....

But we do need to accept the fact that otherwise sensible American housewives who would never grind a quaalude into their morning coffee or sleep with their tennis instructor nevertheless went daft during the 1970s and performed heinous acts of design on unsuspecting homes.<br><br> What James Lileks did for dinner with the critically acclaimed classic <i>The Gallery of Regrettable Food</i>, he now does to the wonderful world of 1970s home interiors. Blazing plaid wallpaper. Vertigo-inducing matching patterns on walls, rugs, chairs, pillows, and blinds. Bathrooms straight out of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>. The whole &#x2019;70s shebang. If you think the &#x2019;80s were dumber than the &#x2019;70s, either you weren&#x2019;t there or you weren&#x2019;t paying attention. <br><br> James Lileks came of age in the 1970s, and for him there was no crueler thing you could inflict upon a person. The music: either sluggish metal, cracker-boogie, or wimpy ballads. Television: camp without the pleasure of knowing it&#x2019;s camp. Politics: the sweaty perfidy of Nixon, the damp uselessness of Ford, the sanctimonious impotence of Carter. The world: nasty. Hair: unspeakable. Architecture: metal-shingled mansard roofs on franchise chicken shops. No oil. No fun. Syphilis and Fonzie.<br><br> <i>Interior Desecrations </i>is the author&#x2019;s revenge on the decade. Using an ungodly collection of the worst of 1970s interior design magazines, books, and pamphlets, he proves without a shadow of a doubt that the &#x2019;70s were a breathtakingly ugly period. And nowhere was that ugliness and lack of style felt more than in our very homes, virtual breeding grounds for bad taste, manifested in brown, orange, and plaid wallpaper patterns. This is what happens when Dad drinks, Mom floats in a Valium haze, the kids slump down in the den with the bong, and the decorator is left to run amok. It seemed so normal at the time. But this book should cure whatever lingering nostalgia we have.<br><br> Exploring all the rooms in the house, Lileks marries the worst of design with the funniest of commentary. His sharp-witted humor, keen eye for detail, and ability to pull the most obscure 1970s references out of his hat make <i>Interior Desecrations</i> the perfect gift for those of us who languished away the decade watching Sonny and Cher, Donny and Marie, and Chico and the Man down in our rec rooms, sprawled out on the shag carpeting, waiting for it all to mercifully end. For those people born later and who may think it was all made up&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t. Would that it was! The photos in this book are not the product of some cruel designer gone crazy with Photoshop. They&#x2019;re all too real. So adjust your sense of style, color, and taste. . . and beware! You&#x2019;ve been warned.</p><p>JAMES LILEKS is the author of <i>The Gallery of Regrettable Food: Highlights from Classic American Recipe Books</i>.

Folks. It's simple. If you have poor taste in decorating, don't go nuts in the entryway. Wait until your guests are inside before you spring something unusual on them. But, you say, doesn't that fabulous statuary look so right over by the door? It's an ancient Belgian God of Fertility or something. You can hang hats on the erection. Or use it for umbrellas! That' s not the point. Most people don't want to encounter this sort of thing right away, if ever. Especially one that's been handpainted in such a unique fashion. Put it in the spare bedroom; it'll keep houseguests from lingering.<br><br>One more rule for bad entryways: don't forget a small table with a bowl on top. It serves no use; there's nothing in the drawer; people bump into it when taking off their coats. But there must be a small table with a bowl on top. It's not the law, but it might as well be.<br><br>The visual equivalent of granulated glass in your eyes. Looking hurts. Blinking hurts. Rubbing hurts. Blindness, when it comes, is almost a comfort.<br><br>It's one of those rooms that almost feels ashamed of itself:<br><br><i>Don't blame me. I had nothing to do with this. I couldn't move. I watched what they did to the kitchen, heard the cupboards scream out as they applied the dots, one by one by one. . . . I knew I was next and there was nothing I could do. It was horrible.</i><br><br>Atrocities like this are partly responsible for the founding, in 1977, of People for the Ethical Treatment of Entryways.<br><br>Says the note in the designer's guide that coughed up this picture:"Gigantic patterned wallpaper in a small area is exciting because it breaks all the rules." Well, a flaming pile of pig crap in the foyer breaks all the rules. Smearing goat brains on the walls breaks all the rules.

What, did people enter through the chimney and leave through the coal chute?<br><br>This is a foyer. This is the first impression.

Something did live there-a fern, perhaps. Some dust mites. A spider. But humans? Rarely. These were showplace rooms, mausoleums where the examples of domestic style were interred. On any given day the sofa and chairs would be sheathed with plastic condoms, lest the fabric be soiled; the drapes drawn lest the hard mean sun suck the color from the cushions. All these rooms needed to complete the picture was Lenin in a glass casket. The people who stuffed their living rooms with this horrid junk would probably have bought plastic covers for the plastic covers, if such a thing had been marketed. Think about it: Your plastic covers keep the fabrics fresh and clean, but what of the covers themselves? Dust, sunlight, pet dander, parakeet psoriasis-why, your plastic covers are depositories of domestic filth.

They reside in Wilmore, Kentucky.january 1 the new year isaiah 43:16 -- 21 I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses. Joshua 1:3 The new year brings hope. As we look into the year that opens before us, we would like to think that it could be better than the one behind us. That yearning for something better is a gift from God and a promise that the hope can be realized. God wants the year before you to be the best that you have ever had. The key lies in where you look for fulfillment. It must not be within yourself, for your resources have not suddenly increased. You need resources that are fresh and new and can enable you to claim a measure of effectiveness and fulfillment that you have not yet known. God is the God who wants to make all things new, and his presence can be recognized by the element of radical promise that confronts us when we come to know him. With God comes the word that the future can be better than the present. When Abraham met God, the experience contained a promise staggeringly large. It was that the barrenness of an old woman and the emptiness of a home would change. In the meeting when God met Moses was the assurance that he was made for more than defeat and shepherding. The promise was given to him that God would use him to set his people free. In fact, Moses was to be God&#39;s man to build a nation. In Joshua&#39;s relationship to God was the promise that God had a land for his wandering people. In David&#39;s communion with God, he learned that God intended to give his people a capital city, a temple, and a throne that would last forever. The Hebrew prophets told of the King who would sit on that throne, one greater than Moses or David, and of a kingdom of people with new hearts where the will of God was not an external command but an inward delight. John the Baptist announced his own role as the messenger who had come to tell the people that the kingdom of heaven was at hand. The very mark of the people of God in the Old Testament was that their faces were turned toward the future and were marked by confidence and expectation. Can we who live on this side of Bethlehem, Calvary, Easter, and Pentecost do otherwise? january 2 all things new revelation 21 He who was seated on the throne said, &#39;I am making everything new!&#39; Then he said, &#39;Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.&#39; Revelation 21:5 Yesterday we spoke of the fact that the people of God are marked by the set of their faces. They look to the future, and they look with anticipation. Implicit in fellowship with God is the promise that the best is yet to be. Of course, there are those in the Old Testament who did not see this. One who seems to be in that class is the writer of Ecclesiastes, who says that there is nothing new under the sun, that what has been will always be, that all things are wearisome, more wearisome than one can express (Eccl. 1:8--10). But this is a minority voice in the Old Testament. * The psalmist tells us of a new song that the Lord has given him (Ps. 42:8). * Isaiah writes of new things to be learned and a new name (Isa. 42:9; 62:2) and of a new heaven and a new earth (Isa. 65:17; 66:22). * Jeremiah proclaims a new covenant and new mercies every morning (Jer. 31:31; Lam. 3:22--23). * Ezekiel tells of a new spirit and a new heart (Ezek. 11:19; 18:31; 36:26). The New Testament picks up this theme and promises * a new birth (1 Peter 1:3), * a new life (Rom. 6:23), * a new self (Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10), * a new attitude (Eph. 4:23), * a new commandment (John 13:34), * a new and living way (Heb. 10:20), * a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15), and * a new heaven and a new earth (2 Peter 3:13; Rev. 21:1). It should be no surprise for us, after we have looked at all the above, to find the concluding word coming from God himself, &#39;I am making all things new&#39; (Rev. 21:5). Apparently God never quits making things better because this word comes as the last word in human history. He is the God of eternal renewal. But what about the author of Ecclesiastes&#39; doleful words? He may be a keener observer than we thought. He says there is nothing new under the sun, and he is right. The true newness never comes from us, from the natural. It comes from beyond us, from the God with whom we have the privilege of walking. Our response has to be: Everything is new under the Son, for it is he who makes all things new. january 3 the holy one isaiah 63 In all their distress he too was distressed, and the angel of his presence saved them. In his love and mercy he redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old. Isaiah 63:9 We have been thinking about the possibilities that come with the presence of God in our lives. The guarantee of that presence, though, can never be assumed. It is conditional. All of the Old Testament illustrates this. God is God alone and is to have no rival or competitor in our lives. He is offended and grieved when we let anything invade that central place intended for him. He is saddened because we inevitably suffer when we let anything encroach on his rights and place. The psalmist understood this. In Psalm 16:4 he notes that sorrows increase for those who &#39;run after other gods,&#39; so he will not participate in offerings or praises given by those with divided hearts. He confesses that Yahweh is Lord and that even the good ceases to be good when God is not in control. That is why Jesus was firm in his insistence that we should seek his rule first (Matt. 6:33). God is God alone, and he is also the Holy One. He hates all that is unclean and all that defiles. As the Holy One, he is a consuming fire. But his burning character was never intended to be destructive to us. It is his means of purging us as he did Isaiah (Isa. 6:5--7). If we care more about his presence with us than we do about our sins and uncleanness, then he will consume our defilements and make us pure. If we become more committed to our sins than we are to him, then his presence becomes destructive to us because of the corruption to which we are wedded. Israel had rejected the preaching of Jeremiah, so God permitted Ezekiel to witness the removal of his presence from Jerusalem. Ezekiel watched as the glory of God, his holy presence, rose from above the ark and from between the cherubim in the Holy of Holies. He saw it move to the threshold of the temple and then leave the city and move to a distant mountaintop. God departed from his people (Ezek. 10:1--20). The result was the destruction of the temple and city and the exile of Israel for seventy years in Babylon. God the Holy One could not live with Israel&#39;s sin. The beauty of all this lies in the fact that God&#39;s presence is better than the experience or the rewards of our sin. And he has the power to make us clean. Charles Wesley understood this and sang about it: He breaks the power of canceled sin, he sets the prisoner free; his blood can make the foulest clean, his blood availed for me.* If we let the Holy One purge us, we will have reason to sing as well.</p><h2>The I Am Discourses: By Beloved Master Jesus the Christ through Lotus Ray King (Saint Germain Series, Vol. 17)</h2><p>This Book is a gift to Beloved Jesus the Christ and presents more of His Instruction before mankind.

A real historical figure, Elizabeth married into the family of Governor John Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In those times of hardship, famine, and Indian attacks, many believed that the only way to prosper was through the strong, bigoted, and theocratic government that John Winthrop favored. Defying the government and her family, Elizabeth befriends famous heretic Anne Hutchinson, challenges an army captain, and dares to love as her heart commanded.

Really good fictionalized history [like this] often gives closer reality to a period than do factual records. <i>Chicago Tribune </i> <br>In 1631 Elizabeth Winthrop, newly widowed with an infant daughter, set sail for the New World. Against this background of rigidity and conformity she dared to befriend Anne Hutchinson at the moment of her banishment from the Massachusetts Bay Colony; dared to challenge a determined army captain bent on the massacre of her friends the Siwanoy Indians; and, above all, dared to love a man as her heart and her whole being commanded. And so, as a response to this almost unmatched courage and vitality, Governor John Winthrop came to refer to this woman in the historical records of the time as his unregenerate niece. <br>Anya Seton s riveting historical novel portrays the fortitude, humiliation, and ultimate triumph of the Winthrop woman, who believed in a concept of happiness transcending that of her own day. <br> A rich and panoramic narrative full of gusto, sentimentality and compassion.

Bob also served four years, both as an enlisted man and an officer. Although trained as an infantryman, he served the final two years (plus one as a civilian), as a historian for the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon.</p><p>Bob returned to the National Park Service in permanent status in September 1957 and served, successively, as Regional Historian of the Southwest Region in Santa Fe, New Mexico, 1957-64; as Chief Historian in Washington DC, 1964-72; as Director, Office of Archeology and Historic Preservation, 1972-73; and as Assistant Director of the National Park Service for Park Historic Preservation, 1973-76. From 1977 to 1980 he was Deputy Executive Director of the President's Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.</p><p>One of the founders of the Western History Association, Bob served on its governing council 1962-74 and as its president 1967-68. He was a member of the editorial board of <i>The American West Magazine</i>, 1964-80. The <i>Western Historical Quarterly</i> was launched during my presidency, and Bob served on its editorial board 1968-73. Bob was also a founder of the Potomac Corral of the Westerners Club in 1955 and its sheriff in 1973, and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Eastern National Park and Monument Association 1985-87 and 1989-92. He has appeared frequently on television productions related to the history of the West (<i>Real West,</i> for example, and <i>How the West Was Lost</i>, as well as others on the History, Discovery, and other channels).</p><p>In 1974 Purdue University awarded Bob an Honorary Doctor of Letters degree, followed by the University of New Mexico in 1976 and Indiana University in 1981. In 1971 Bob received the Department of the Interior's Distinguished Service Award.</p><p>Since 1980 Bob has been married to Melody Webb, also a National Park Service veteran and also a historian.<b><br></b></p>"I have no hesitation in labeling this the best single volume ever published on the Custer Battle and the Sioux War of 1876." &#x2013;<b>Robert M. Utley</b><br><br>"In his soundly documented and absorbing book John Gray manages with cumulative power what few have attempted: a total view of the U.S. Army campaign against the Sioux in 1976 - that strange wilderness war whose centerpiece was the Custer 'massacre.' There's no nonsense here, no romantic pseudo-history. Gray uses authentic sources with critical insight, calls his shots clearly and bluntly."&nbsp;&#x2013;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"A fine book . . .. Gray gives us the whole story in an integrated package . . .. In the twenty-two chapters that comprise the background and the campaign narrative, the author is at his best when he moves away from the Washington scene to detail the field operations. But it is the second part of the book - seven chapters labeled "facets" - that moves Centennial Campaign into the realm of the exceptional. Here Dr. Gray combines impressive research, careful analysis, and sound deduction to reconstruct Indian movements, locations, and concentrations." &#x2013;<i>Western Historical Quarterly</i><br><br>"[Gray's] views are occasionally controversial, but are based on a careful consideration of the primary material. By avoiding the many garbled secondary accounts, he brings some fresh insights to the issues. A series of good maps helps the reader follow campaign activity. This is a thoughtful study of a tragic, unnecessary war." &#x2013;<b>Roger L.

The Victoria and Albert Museum, London, contains by far the most important and extensive collection of English silk designs in the world, some bound as they were originally, others loose, and still more as samples of fabric in pattern books. The designs changed with the season and, through these pages, we can see fashion evolving from the extravagances of the 'bizarre' silks of the early eighteenth century, through the 'lace' patterns and three-dimensional effects of the 1720s and 1730s, to the Rococo of the 1740s, the stylization of the 1750s and 1760s and, finally, to the Neo-Classicism of the 1770s and later. The diversity in motif and pattern is astonishing, and subtleties of texture contrast with colours as brilliant and fresh as they were two centuries ago.<br>Here, in more than 250 magnificent colour illustrations, is a treasure house of inspiration for today's designers, a captivating record for students of costume and textiles, and a delight for anyone who loves things of beauty.</p><p>Clare Browne is Assistant Curator in the Textiles and Dress Collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum.</p><h2>Runaways: The Complete Collection Volume 1</h2><p>They were six normal teenagers linked only by their wealthy parents' annual business meeting...until a chance discovery revealed the shocking truth: their parents are the secret criminal society known as the Pride!

He has experience in over 70 countries and, as a journalist, has covered multiple conflicts. His work has appeared in a wide range of publications and he serves on the advisory board of Armchair General magazine. He lives in Virginia.Second in Parry's praised Civil War series (after Faded Coat of Blue), this uncommonly engaging historical drama, the second to feature Abel JonesAUnion officer, reluctant detective, and loyal confidential agent for President LincolnA stirs the imagination with its vivid color, gripping suspense and wartime historical accuracy. In the winter of 1862, Major Jones, an immigrant Welshman now in the Union Army, is sent to northern New York to investigate rumors of an Irish insurrection among those who oppose the war. Two federal undercover agents have already been brutally murdered, and Jones knows this will be a delicate and dangerous mission. He boldly sets out for the prosperous town of Penn Yan, N.Y., with no disguise or cover story, proclaiming to all that he is there to investigate the murders and the rumors of rebellion. His presence is at once feared and welcomed, and he naturally becomes the target of the Irish troublemakers, members of a group called Whiteboys. The Irish insurrection, however, is only the front for a larger operation, and Jones soon finds himself in even deeper personal and professional danger. Aided by beautiful Nellie Kildare, who is either a madwoman or a mystic, and thwarted by the manipulative man who passes as her father, Jones and his thieving and conniving friend, Jimmy Molloy, uncover a plot that threatens to cripple the North. Jones is an endearing literary character who should gracefully weather further sequels. He is a war hero who hates war almost as much as he hates horses, admits he does not understand women and thinks the ancient Greeks were a bad sort. Bright but not brilliant, flawed but not troubled, Jones is an ordinary man with an extraordinary sense of duty. Parry has created a thoroughly likable and believable character and engages him here in a riveting adventure.

He has written over thirty novels under his own name and more than twenty bestselling historical novels featuring Richard Bolitho under the pseudonym Alexander Kent.A young and earnest Captain Richard Bolitho bravely faces the shot and ball thrown at his British ship by American patriots, managing one narrow escape by sailing over a shallow bar. Michael Jayston's raspy voice is deep and sure of itself as it spins these sea yarns. In the way of a good storyteller, he sometimes gets excited or takes on an accent, but he always stays easily understood. The author's muse contributes "tightly reefed topsails, the clank of pumps, and the smell of gun smoke in battle" to provide the narrator with stories of the Revolutionary War that are both educational and in good taste.

Yet through much of history, across many cultures, the female leg was kept covered and treated as taboo, until it became an object of sexual obsession. In Victorian times, the word &#x2019;leg&#x2019; was forbidden in polite society, lest gentlemen be driven wild with lust. Even now, 80 years after women&#x2019;s legs finally came out of hiding, their allure remains mysterious and powerful.</p><p>The third in Dian Hanson&#x2019;s wildly successful series on erotic body parts explores how the female leg became central to women&#x2019;s emacipation, from the French Revolution to the sexual revolution. Over 400 photos document the first burlesque shows of the 1800s, the silk-stockinged flappers of the 20s, the nylon-mania of the 40s, the dawn of the stiletto in the 50s, and the golden age of leg magazines in the 60s. Who wore the first high heels, how did nylons become a weapon of war, why were Betty Grable&#x2019;s the "million dollar legs," where did Elmer Batters get his start, and just what is the deal with feet? The answers are all here, along with vintage photos by Irving Klaw, Peter Gowland, Bunny Yeager, Batters, and other great masters of leg art.</p></p><p>Dian Hanson produced a variety of men&#x2019;s magazines from 1976 to 2001, including Juggs, Outlaw Biker, and Leg Show, before becoming TASCHEN&#x2019;s Sexy Book Editor. Her titles include the &#x201c;body part&#x201d; series, The Art of Pin-up, Psychedelic Sex, and Ren Hang.&#34;After the bountiful The Big Book of Breasts comes this smorgasboard of beautiful body parts. Taking in everything from naughty French postcards to Bond girls and burlesque pin-up Betty Page, this is a tribute to the dynamite combination of stockings, suspenders and lithe, long-limbed sirens.&#34;</p><h2>Urban Design Handbook: Techniques and Working Methods (Norton Book for Architects and Designers (Paperback))</h2><p><p><strong>Based on Urban Design Associates&#x2019; in-house training procedures, this unique handbook details the techniques and working methods of a major urban design and planning firm.</strong></p> Covering the process from basic principles to developed designs, the book outlines the range of project types and services that urban designers can offer and sets out a set of general operating guidelines and procedures for: <ul><li>Developing a master plan, including techniques for engaging citizens in the design process and technical analysis to evaluate the physical form of the neighborhood, centered on a design charrette with public participation;</li><li>Preparing a pattern book to guide residential construction in a new traditional town, including the documentation of architectural and urban precedents in a form that can be used by architects and builders;</li><li>Implementing contextual architectural design, including methods of applying the essential qualities of traditional architecture in many styles to modern programs and construction techniques.</li></ul><p>This invaluable guide offers an introductory course in urbanism as well as an operations manual for architects, planners, developers, and public officials.</p> 300 color illustrations</p><p>Urban Design Associates is a Pittsburgh-based national practice that creatively engages citizens to revitalize city neighborhoods, transform public housing, bring new life to downtowns and waterfronts, and build new traditional towns.&#x201c;Stuffed with specifics... new urbanists and city enthusiasts everywhere will enjoy it as an entertaining and instructive reference.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Philip Langdon, <em>New Urban News</em></strong></p><h2>The View from Lazy Point: A Natural Year in an Unnatural World</h2><p><p>An exhilarating journey of natural renewal through a year with MacArthur fellow Carl Safina</p><p>Beginning in his kayak in his home waters of eastern Long Island, Carl Safina's <i>The View from Lazy Point</i> takes us through the four seasons to the four points of the compass, from the high Arctic south to Antarctica, across the warm belly of the tropics from the Caribbean to the west Pacific, then home again.

He lives in Amagansett, New York.</p><p><strong>Prelude</strong></p><p>I slide a fishing rod into my kayak as birds begin gathering over our bay. They know what&#x2019;s coming. So do I. On many summer afternoons, packs of surfacing Bluefish chase up small fish, drawing excited flocks of diving terns. The terns carry those little fish a few miles to hungry youngsters waiting eagerly on small, unpeopled islands. As it has been for millennia, so it is this very moment.</p><p>Having long studied&#x2014;and saut�ed&#x2014;this aspect of our neighborhood both formally and at leisure, applying both statistical models and garlic as appropriate, I can report that this relationship&#x2014;prey fish, terns, Bluefish, and me&#x2014;shows scant sign of failing anytime soon.</p><p>The future is by no means doomed. I&#x2019;m continually struck by how much beauty and vitality the world still holds.</p><p>But beauty and vitality isn&#x2019;t the whole story either. In the panic among the fishes and in the frenzying terns, it&#x2019;s also evident that nature has neither sentiment nor mercy. What it does have is life, truth, and logic. And it strives for what it cannot have: an end to danger, an assurance of longevity, a moment&#x2019;s peace, and a comfortable death. It&#x2019;s like us all, because we are natural. What anyone needs to know about mercy, one can learn by watching nature strive, seeing people struggle, and realizing what a compassionate mind could add to the picture. So I&#x2019;m also struck that we who have named ourselves &#x201c;wise humans&#x201d;&#x2014;<em>Homo sapiens</em>&#x2014;haven&#x2019;t quite realized that nature, civilization, peace, and human dignity are all facets of the same gemstone, and that abrasion of one tarnishes the whole.</p><p>My neighbor&#x2019;s cottage is right on the bay, and where I launch my kayak I find him wading waist-deep with a spade, digging sea-worms for bait. Bob hopes to slide a few porgies into his frying pan by sundown. I ask how the worm digging&#x2019;s going. Squinting against shards of summer light jabbing upward from the water, he says, &#x201c;S-l-o-w. Even the worms are getting scarcer.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d earlier commented on the dearth of clams. Just a few years ago we could wade out right here and, using merely our feet to detect buried clams, emerge in an hour lugging four dozen. The hour now yields perhaps half a dozen. Nothing too mysterious; a few too many people from elsewhere, having raked over their spots, found our spot. The whole world has a pretty similar story to tell.</p><p>But I don&#x2019;t pretend to speak for the sea-worms or the clams. The voiceless among us got on for hundreds of millions of years without hearing from me.</p><p>It&#x2019;s true that a lot was gone by the time I got here, and that worms are waning and clams are counting down. But, there&#x2019;s quite a lot left. Maybe not a lot of clams (though I&#x2019;ve found a couple of decent pockets in the harbor, and my neighbor Dennis generously clued me to a heavy set over in&#x2014;well, I probably shouldn&#x2019;t say), but I mean in general, a lot remains. And some of what had gone has returned. You&#x2019;ll see. As watching those terns and fish and the activities of my human neighbors continually reminds me, the world still brims with the living.</p><p>Yet here&#x2019;s the paradox: In the cycle of seasons and the waves of migrating fishes and birds that come and go along my home coast, I still find sanity, solace, and delight, more than a few fresh meals, and the power and resilience of living things; the wider lens of distant horizons, however, reveals people and nature up against trends serious enough to rattle civilization in this century.</p><p>This is a chronicle of a year spent partly along local shores, partly exploring the world from polar regions of the Arctic, across the tropics, down into the Antarctic, and home again. In some ways, this could be any year; in some ways, it couldn&#x2019;t be any other.</p><p>The world still sings. Yet the warnings are wise. We have lost much, and we&#x2019;re risking much more. Some risks, we see coming. But there are also certainties hurtling our way that we fail to notice. The dinosaurs failed to anticipate the meteoroid that extinguished them. But dinosaurs didn&#x2019;t create their own calamity. Many others don&#x2019;t deserve the calamities we&#x2019;re creating.</p><p>We&#x2019;re borrowing heavily from people not yet born. Meanwhile, the framework with which we run our lives and our world&#x2014;our philosophy, ethics, religion, and economics&#x2014;can&#x2019;t seem to detect the risks we&#x2019;re running. How could they? They&#x2019;re ancient and medieval institutions, out of sync with what we&#x2019;ve learned in the last century about how the world really works.</p><p>So, how to proceed? I&#x2019;ve come to see that the geometry of human progress is an expanding circle of compassion. And that nature and human dignity require each other. And I believe that&#x2014;if the word &#x201c;sacred&#x201d; means anything at all&#x2014;the world exists as the one truly sacred place. Simple things, right?</p><p>As we walk the shores and launch our travels, several axes of possibility&#x2014;evidence, ignorance, indifference, and compassion&#x2014;will form the north, south, east, and west upon which we&#x2019;ll plot our course.</p><p>Amagansett, Long Island<br>June 2010</p><p><strong>The View from Lazy Point</strong></p><p>My dog, Kenzie, a fifty-pound black wolf&#x2014;more or less&#x2014;goes loping along the shore as is her custom, energetically invested in the obvious truth that all adventure lies at the tip of one&#x2019;s nose. The familiar is always also the exotic, and if you can detect the scent and follow it, it&#x2019;ll take you far. And soon, as always, she&#x2019;s way ahead.</p><p>Today we woke to glass-calm water. The Sound is stretched taut to the far points of land. Out across the open water, the sea melds with hazy air and blends skyward without horizon. On a morning this placid and beautiful, dying and going to heaven wouldn&#x2019;t be worth it.</p><p>A few years ago, I became the &#x201c;owner&#x201d; of a beach cottage that had fallen into such disrepair that I could afford it. One can own an apartment or a condo or a suburban home, but when a place is already old, and if it sits amid dune grass and wild Beach Plums, and a box turtle comes confidently seeking the blackberries it has known about for decades, you feel&#x2014;at least I feel&#x2014;like the property has many owners and I&#x2019;m just the newest tenant.</p><p>As much as I admire Henry Beston&#x2019;s classic <em>The Outermost House,</em> this is not a story about getting a little place out past the edge of the world and finding one&#x2019;s self in the solitude and the peace. This story is, though, partly about going home, about immersing in rhythms that come naturally. As a kid I&#x2019;d stalk shallow waters with a net in my hand, captivated by shadows of tiny sand-colored fishes fanning away from me. Despite added detail and time, I&#x2019;m still the minnow-chasing boy.</p><p>But this story&#x2019;s also partly about a kind of heartbreak for a world that remains so vitally unaware of how imperiled it is. The more I sense the miracle, the more intense appears the tragedy. The only way to feel better, then, is to appreciate less, which would of course feel worse. Let&#x2019;s put a positive spin on it and say that for now the miracle is winning.</p><p>So this story is also about the tension created when those things mistakenly called &#x201c;the real world&#x201d;&#x2014;though they are entirely artificial&#x2014;continually intrude on the <em>real</em> real world. In a <em>real</em> place, the mysteries of ages pile thick with enduring truths and complex beauties.</p><p>And that&#x2019;s why I was looking for a house. I&#x2019;d hoped to find a home in a certain fishing village. Well, the fishing village was turning into a resort, with prices to match. The next town was long since unaffordable, too. So one day I ended up down a road through a marsh popular with mosquitoes, looking at a dilapidated summer cottage with no windows and a square hole in the roof with no skylight. It was bright&#x2014;and certainly airy&#x2014;but humidity posed a problem. Some of the inner walls had been torn from the studs, freeing a bloom of insulation and leaving exposed wires in a puddle under the skylight hole. Better houses have been demolished. I wisely dismissed that house as a wreck, out of the question.</p><p>I walked across the street, over the dune, and got a glimpse of the water. A five-minute beach walk took me to where a broad, shallow bay communicates with the Sound through a deep, fast-flowing channel about as wide as I might be able to cast a heavy lure. Even in the late winter, when I first laid eyes on it, I could see that this channel would be fishy in springtime. The house said I&#x2019;d be crazy. The place said I was home.</p><p>It&#x2019;s called Lazy Point. I&#x2019;ve been told the name derives from ne&#x2019;er-do-well baymen who&#x2019;d come to squat on worthless land. Whether or not that&#x2019;s true, I don&#x2019;t much care; I like the name.</p><p>In summer the place is idyllic; it can make anyone lazy. But in winter it takes effort to get comfortable with the gales. I once read that the incessant howl of wind on the prairie could drive settlers mad. I couldn&#x2019;t really understand how&#x2014;until my first winter alone at Lazy Point.</p><p>The cottages sit on a flat peninsula of scrubby pines between the Sound and the bay. That fishy channel I mentioned; I call it &#x201c;the Cut.&#x201d; Along the bay&#x2019;s south shore runs the railroad, then the main road&#x2014;two lanes&#x2014;then high dunes, then the sandy ocean beach that continues on for miles. In winter it&#x2019;s deserted and I have it to myself. We call the ocean beach &#x201c;the south side.&#x201d; And beyond the ocean: more ocean to the blue horizon, beyond that to the edge of the continental shelf&#x2014;under six hundred feet of water&#x2014;and then the deep sea, the Gulf Stream, and the rest of the world. You can feel it.</p><p>The harbor village is about five miles east; another six miles and you get to Montauk Point, a defiantly reared-up, jutting jaw of land&#x2014;exposed to the open ocean on the south, and e...</p></p><h2>I Can&#39;t Breathe: A Killing on Bay Street</h2><p><b>A work of riveting literary journalism that explores the roots and repercussions of the infamous killing of Eric Garner by the New York City police&#x2014;from the bestselling author of <i>The Divide</i></b><br><br><b>NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <i>THE WASHINGTON POST</i></b><br><br> On July 17, 2014, a forty-three-year-old black man named Eric Garner died on a Staten Island sidewalk after a police officer put him in what has been described as an illegal chokehold during an arrest for selling bootleg cigarettes. The final moments of Garner&#x2019;s life were captured on video and seen by millions. His agonized last words, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t breathe,&#x201d; became a rallying cry for the nascent Black Lives Matter protest movement. A grand jury ultimately declined to indict the officer who wrestled Garner to the pavement.<br> &nbsp;<br> Matt Taibbi&#x2019;s deeply reported retelling of these events liberates Eric Garner from the abstractions of newspaper accounts and lets us see the man in full&#x2014;with all his flaws and contradictions intact. A husband and father with a complicated personal history, Garner was neither villain nor victim, but a fiercely proud individual determined to do the best he could for his family, bedeviled by bad luck, and ultimately subdued by forces beyond his control.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In America, no miscarriage of justice exists in isolation, of course, and in <i>I Can&#x2019;t Breathe</i> Taibbi also examines the conditions that made this tragedy possible. Featuring vivid vignettes of life on the street and inside our Kafkaesque court system, Taibbi&#x2019;s kaleidoscopic account illuminates issues around policing, mass incarceration, the underground economy, and racial disparity in law enforcement. No one emerges unsullied, from the conservative district attorney who half-heartedly prosecutes the case to the progressive mayor caught between the demands of outraged activists and the foot-dragging of recalcitrant police officials.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> A masterly narrative of urban America and a scathing indictment of the perverse incentives built into our penal system, <i>I Can&#x2019;t Breathe</i> drills down into the particulars of one case to confront us with the human cost of our broken approach to dispensing criminal justice.<br><br><b>&#x201c;Brilliant . . .

On this afternoon, he was parked on private property, a muddy driveway in front of a friend&#x2019;s apartment building. The noise came from the driver&#x2019;s side of his spiffily maintained 2011 Toyota Camry.<br><br>Annan looked up and saw a white man with a hoodie obscuring most of his face, rapping on the window.<br><br>Bang bang bang!<br><br>&#x201c;Open the fucking window before I break your fucking arm!&#x201d;<br><br>Annan looked past his dashboard and saw another figure standing at about ten o&#x2019;clock, also dressed in street clothes. This one was aiming a gun at him.<br><br>Annan froze. He was a regular visitor to this address, 100 Pierce Street, on the northern side of the island. It&#x2019;s a dull three-�story apartment building, nestled in a sleepy mixed-�race neighborhood of run-�down one-�family homes. He had a key to an apartment there belonging to his friend, a local DJ known as Icebox International. The two sometimes mixed music inside. He would later say he was there that day to visit his friend on the way back from the post office.<br><br>The police version of this story is different. They say Ibrahim Annan pulled into the parking spot and immediately began ostentatiously playing around in his front seat with a giant baggie of weed, which they would describe in a criminal complaint as a &#x201c;ziplock bag of marihuana.&#x201d;<br><br>This &#x201c;ziplock bag&#x201d; in the complaint was described as being &#x201c;open to public view.&#x201d; By unsurprising coincidence, New York City police are not supposed to arrest people for marijuana possession unless the subject is &#x201c;publicly displaying&#x201d; the drug. If you&#x2019;re carrying it or even smoking it in private, it&#x2019;s just a ticket. But at the time, tens of thousands of New Yorkers were criminally arrested for pot possession every year, which either pointed to an epidemic of exhibitionist drug use or a lot of iffy police reports.<br><br>Bang bang bang!<br><br>&#x201c;OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!&#x201d;<br><br>A dependable rule of thumb in police brutality cases is that the worst incidents are triggered by something the suspect says. A lot of these episodes are already running hot before they fully erupt. They often start with the police tackling someone, putting a knee in his or her back, hurling obscenities (to be fair, sometimes in retaliation for obscenities thrown at them). So it doesn&#x2019;t take much to raise the collective temperature beyond the bursting point. An F-�bomb or two will usually do it.<br><br>Annan yelled back: &#x201c;Get a fucking warrant!&#x201d;<br><br>Boom! The inside of Annan&#x2019;s car exploded with glass as the officer in the hoodie used something&#x2014;�a nightstick maybe?&#x2014;�to shatter the driver&#x2019;s-side window. At the hospital later on, Annan would have glass fragments removed from his eyes.<br><br>Annan turned his face to the right to avoid the impact. But when he opened his eyes, he was immediately struck on the left side of his face with what he thought was an ASP, a kind of telescoping metal baton used by police all over the country.<br><br>Another policeman had opened the passenger-�side door and was also striking him repeatedly with something. He heard the impact of steel on his skull before he felt it.<br><br>Meanwhile the original officer in the hoodie was yanking at his seat belt. The Toyota dealership would later have to replace the seat belt lock, which is designed to withstand car accidents. It was broken and ripped loose in the struggle.<br><br>After more than twenty blows to his face and head, Annan was pulled from the car and thrown to the ground. A police cruiser had driven up beside his car, and he was now facedown in the mud and glass, obscured in a narrow spot between two vehicles. Annan says he screamed for bystanders behind the cars to reach for their cellphones.<br><br>&#x201c;Film them!&#x201d; he screamed. &#x201c;Film them!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shut the fuck up!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Film them!&#x201d;<br><br>Hands pulled behind his back, Annan felt a set of cuffs go on. Officers were raining blows down on him from all angles. He detected a strange sensation in his left leg and tried to protest.<br><br>&#x201c;Yo, hey, the ankle cuff is too tight!&#x201d; he gasped.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The cuff on my ankle! It&#x2019;s too tight!&#x201d;<br><br>In fact, there was no cuff on his ankle. Annan&#x2019;s left leg had been stomped on repeatedly, broken in three places, the damage so severe he would still be walking with a cane more than a year later.<br><br>Annan tried to focus. He looked down at the mud in front of him. The blows were coming so furiously that he began to worry that he would die here, in this coffin-�sized space between two cars.<br><br>His legs and wrists were throbbing and now he also felt something, a hand maybe, sliding under his neck, preparing maybe for a headlock. In his panic he felt himself losing air and spoke three words destined to become famous in another man&#x2019;s mouth.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t breathe,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Shut the fuck up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious. I can&#x2019;t breathe!&#x201d;<br><br>One of the officers answered him: &#x201c;You can fucking talk, you can fucking breathe.&#x201d;<br><br>In the ambulance a few minutes after his beating, Annan was beside himself. He looked at his mangled left foot and nodded at the officer.<br><br>&#x201c;Where do you live?&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;Identify yourself!&#x201d;<br><br>The cop shook his head, then leaned forward and punched Annan in the face.<br><br>The EMT in the front of the vehicle said nothing and kept driving.<br><br>The borough of Staten Island would later charge Annan seven hundred dollars for the ambulance ride.<br><br>Ibrahim Annan was well known to the staff of the Richmond University Medical Center. He and his sister both suffered from sickle cell anemia and had come there regularly for treatment their whole lives.<br><br>Now Annan was pushed through the door of the ER on a gurney. He was shouting, hysterically, at the top of his lungs.<br><br>&#x201c;They attacked me and broke my leg! Don&#x2019;t let them hurt me! Don&#x2019;t let them hurt me!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shut up,&#x201d; one of the officers muttered.<br><br>Annan&#x2019;s gurney was moved to a private room. Inside, the hospital staff implored him to keep his mouth shut. He was eventually handcuffed to his bed and then wheeled off to a far corner of the ER.<br><br>Much later in the evening, after word of his detention had finally reached his family, Annan&#x2019;s youngest sister, Mariama, wandered through the emergency room, looking for her brother.<br><br>Mariama caught a glimpse of him from afar, his face bloodied and his leg smashed. &#x201c;I had never seen him like that before,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It was awful.&#x201d;<br><br>The police wouldn&#x2019;t let her or anyone else in the family visit him or even learn exactly what had happened, so she had to steal a glance from a distance.<br><br>&#x201c;The incident completely changed the way I think about everything&#x2014;�the government, the police, everything,&#x201d; she said later. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t trust the nurses because they were following the police instructions. I was afraid to leave him there with any of them.&#x201d;<br><br>Annan&#x2019;s parents also tried to get access to Ibrahim. It took more than a full day and multiple trips back and forth to Staten Island&#x2019;s infamous 120th Precinct before the two slow-�moving, elderly Africans were finally given a pass to see their son. As immigrants they had a poor instinct for the uglier nuances of American culture and were puzzled by every part of the process.<br><br>The deal for the pass had been brokered by Mariama. She pleaded with a desk sergeant at the 120th Precinct, an outpost that had for decades been the subject of horror stories within the island&#x2019;s nonwhite community, who refer to it darkly as the &#x201c;One Two Oh.&#x201d;<br><br>On the street in certain parts of Staten Island, people believe the 120 is where they send all the reject cops from other precincts, especially the ones with too many abuse complaints. The precinct jailhouse in particular has a terrible reputation for, among other things, its smell and poor ventilation. Even hardened criminals go the extra mile to try to avoid landing there, even for a night.<br><br>Mariama remembers the moment when she got the pass. She was standing in the precinct with her two parents when finally, the desk man shook his head and sighed.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;ll give them a pass,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But only because they&#x2019;re fucking old.&#x201d;<br><br>Mariama nearly fainted.<br><br>&#x201c;I was afraid for my parents,&#x201d; she said later. &#x201c;They were shocked by the language. These are elderly, proper people. They could have had a heart attack.&#x201d;<br><br>After a bedside arraignment in the hospital, Ibrahim Annan faced a litany of charges: menacing, criminal possession of marijuana in the fifth degree, obstructing government administration, unlawful possession of marijuana, assault in the second degree, and assault in the third degree, among others.<br><br>Annan&#x2019;s family later hired a tall, sharply dressed African American lawyer named Gregory Watts. He would grumblingly describe the charges of assaulting the police.<br><br>&#x201c;They smashed the guy&#x2019;s car window, and one of them got a little cut after they beat his ass up,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the assault.&#x201d;<br><br>The last charge was criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree. The police explanation for that charge is that when they banged on Ibrahim Annan&#x2019;s car window, the accused responded by holding up a lighter and an aerosol can and shouting at armed police from inside a closed vehicle, &#x201c;IF YOU OPEN THE WINDOW I&#x2019;M GOING TO BURN YOU.&#x201d; The officers used all caps in the complaint. Annan would later claim he never even read that part of the charges. &#x201c;I said what?&#x201d; he asked, incredulous.<br><br>The long list of charges slapped on Annan were part of an elaborate game police and prosecutors often play with people caught up in &#x201c;problematic&#x201d; arrests. A black man with a shattered leg has a virtually automatic argument for certain kinds of federal civil rights lawsuits. But those suits are harder to win when the arrest results in a conviction. So when police beat someone badly enough, the city&#x2019;s first line of defense is often to go on offense and file a long list of charges, hoping one will stick. Civil lawyers meanwhile will often try to wait until the criminal charges are beaten before they file suit.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a leverage game. If the beating is on the severe side, the victim has the power to take the city for a decent sum of money. But that&#x2019;s just money, and it comes out of the taxpayer&#x2019;s pocket. The state, meanwhile, has the power to make the losses in this particular poker game very personal. It can put the loser in jail and on the way there can take up years of his or her life in court appearances. As Annan would find out, time is the state&#x2019;s ultimate trump card.<br><br>Annan was in the hospital for more than three weeks. His ankle had to be reconstructed surgically.<br><br>When he finally went home, he was mostly immobile. It was spring outside, and he missed seeing the weather turn warm.<br><br>Feeling better one day in the beginning of May, however, he decided to get some fresh air. With the aid of a walker, he went outside and headed down toward Bay Street, near the water.<br><br>The big man in the doorway saw everything. He knew this part of the island like the back of his hand. Anything in this little crisscrossed city block that looked or felt out of place, he registered instantly.<br><br>If you judged this man by his clothes, you missed a lot. He looked a mess from the outside. He&#x2019;d change T-�shirts every day, but the giant XXL sweatpants were often the same smudged and stained pair from the day before. The big man suffered from sleep apnea and chronic allergies, which left his nose constantly running. A hundred times a day or more, he&#x2019;d wipe his nose with his fingers, then wipe his fingers on those sweatpants.<br><br>Eric Garner&#x2019;s one recent concession to fashion was a pair of shell-�toe Adidas sneakers, made iconic in New York by Run-�DMC, a band he was crazy for as a kid growing up in Brooklyn. His sneakers were huge&#x2014;�size 16&#x2014;�and yet still too small for him, because he also suffered from diabetes and his swollen feet spilled out of his shoes.<br><br>Some of his friends on the street called him &#x201c;Elephant Foot.&#x201d; But it really wasn&#x2019;t that funny. The swelling from his illnesses left him in constant pain, which was a problem because his job required him to stand in place, rain or shine, hot summer or biting winter, for as much as ten or twelve hours a day.<br><br>His usual place of work was on a little stretch of Bay Street, on Staten Island&#x2019;s North Shore. He spent most of his time there, circling a small triangular patch of trash-�strewn grass called Tompkinsville Park. The park, which used to be nicknamed Needle Park, contains a dozen or so benches, a big red brick public toilet building long ago locked up by authorities, and a view of New York&#x2019;s Upper Bay. On most days it&#x2019;s also home to a collection of dope fiends, drifters, crackheads, and alcoholics. They come here to hang out, get high, drink, argue, and trash-�talk.<br><br>Just a hundred yards or so from this crowd, on the water side of the park, sits a new fifty-�seven-�unit condominium complex bearing the absurdly pretentious name &#x201c;The Pointe at St. George.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Pointe&#x201d; is part of a major Staten Island renewal project called the Bay Street corridor, an ambitious plan to invest nearly a billion dollars in a string of high-�end residential buildings that would dot the waterfront leading to the Staten Island Ferry. A two-�bedroom unit at the &#x201c;luxury, full-�service&#x201d; condo complex sells for half a million dollars or more. A nice starter home for an entry-�level Wall Street hustler, perhaps, who wants a water view at night and doesn&#x2019;t mind reading the Financial Times on a morning ferry ride to downtown Manhattan.<br><br>The condos looked like great investments but for one thing: the view across the street. Needle Park is an old-�school New York street hangout&#x2014;�not too dangerous, but visually rough around the edges and definitely way too black for anyone who&#x2019;d spend a half-�million dollars to spell &#x201c;Point&#x201d; with an &#x201c;e.&#x201d;<br><br>When this place was just a straight-�up shooting gallery in the early 2000s, police hardly ever came by. But now that the park was on the edge of a billion-�dollar real estate investment, the police were always coming around, mixing it up with the park&#x2019;s denizens over one thing or another. Nickel-�and-�dime stuff, mostly, what the police call &#x201c;quality of life&#x201d; arrests: drinking from open containers, peeing on the sidewalk, disorderly conduct.</p><h2>The Confederate War</h2><p><p> If one is to believe contemporary historians, the South never had a chance. Many allege that the Confederacy lost the Civil War because of internal division or civilian disaffection; others point to flawed military strategy or ambivalence over slavery. But, argues distinguished historian Gary Gallagher, we should not ask why the Confederacy collapsed so soon but rather how it lasted so long. In <i>The Confederate War</i> he reexamines the Confederate experience through the actions and words of the people who lived it to show how the home front responded to the war, endured great hardships, and assembled armies that fought with tremendous spirit and determination. </p><p> Gallagher's portrait highlights a powerful sense of Confederate patriotism and unity in the face of a determined adversary. Drawing on letters, diaries, and newspapers of the day, he shows that Southerners held not only an unflagging belief in their way of life, which sustained them to the bitter end, but also a widespread expectation of victory and a strong popular will closely attuned to military events. In fact, the army's "offensive-defensive" strategy came remarkably close to triumph, claims Gallagher--in contrast to the many historians who believe that a more purely defensive strategy or a guerrilla resistance could have won the war for the South. To understand why the South lost, Gallagher says we need look no further than the war itself: after a long struggle that brought enormous loss of life and property, Southerners finally realized that they had been beaten on the battlefield. </p><p> Gallagher's interpretation of the Confederates and their cause boldly challenges current historical thinking and invites readers to reconsider their own conceptions of the American Civil War. </p></p><p>[Gallagher&#39;s] perceptive and engaging new book maintains that historians have got off track in recent years by attributing Confederate defeat to weakness on the home front rather than to performance on the battlefield. War-weariness, lack of will and ambivalence toward the cause of independence, they say, doomed the South ... Gallagher addresses the right issues, asks probing questions and suggests intriguing alternatives.-Daniel E. Sutherland, New York Times Book Review<b>Gary W.

During strawberry season, I like to stock up and will buy one or two flats of strawberries. I'll bring them home, prep them, load up my dehydrator and then we get to enjoy dried strawberries long after strawberry season is over. </p><p> I also love making healthy snacks like fruit roll-ups, crackers and chips for my two young boys. This way I have control over the quality of ingredients used -- no preservatives, or artificial colors and flavorings. The boys prefer them to store-bought snacks because they taste better, and I prefer it because they're not packed with empty calories and little nutrition. </p><p> Another great benefit of dehydrating, of course, is that it's so economical compared with buying pre-packaged dried snacks or herbs in the store. But the number one reason I use my dehydrator over other appliances in my kitchen is for the health benefits. The human body is made up of living cells that need living "live" food to maintain optimal health and prevent disease. Every day we have the choice to eat living "live" food or cooked "dead" food. When you use a dehydrator and dehydrate your foods under 118 degrees Fahrenheit (47 degrees Celsius), they remain "live" and retain the majority of their nutrients, as opposed to literally cooking the life out of them. </p><p> This book will take you through the process for dehydrating each type of food with helpful hints and delicious recipes. Each chapter focuses on a different skill, from drying simple fruits and vegetables to making fruit leathers, creating tasty jerky, dehydrating nuts and seeds, creating delicious raw meals and sweets, and even making healthy treats for your pets. Once you have the hang of a particular skill, feel free to experiment with different ingredients and flavors; you'll find dehydrating a very forgiving method of preparing food, once you've mastered the basics. </p><p> Karielyn Tillman<br> thehealthyfamilyandhome.com </p></p><h2>The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke</h2><p>More than two decades ago, the women&#39;s movement flung open the doors of the workplace. Although this social revolution created a firestorm of controversy, no one questioned the idea that women&#39;s involvement in the workforce was certain to improve families&#39; financial lot. Until now.In this brilliantly argued book, Harvard Law School bankruptcy expert Elizabeth Warren and business consultant Amelia Tyagi show that today&#39;s middle-class parents are suffering from an unprecedented and totally unexpected economic meltdown. Astonishingly, sending mothers to work has made families more vulnerable than ever before. Today&#39;s two-income family earns 75% more money than its single-income counterpart of a generation ago, but actually has less discretionary income once their fixed monthly bills are paid.How did this happen? Warren and Tyagi provide convincing evidence that the culprit is not &#34;overconsumption,&#34; as many critics have charged. Instead, they point to the ferocious bidding war for housing and education that has quietly engulfed America&#39;s suburbs. Stay-at-home mothers once provided a financial safety net if disaster struck; their move into the workforce has left today&#39;s families chillingly at risk. The authors show why the usual remedies--child-support enforcement, subsidized daycare, and higher salaries for women--won&#39;t solve the problem, and propose a set of innovative solutions, from rate caps on credit cards to open-access public schools, to restore security to the middle class.</p><p><b>Elizabeth Warren</b> is the Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law at Harvard Law School.

She lives in Pacific Palisades, California, with her husband and two-year-old daughter, Octavia.Warren, a law professor at Harvard (The Fragile Middle Class) and her daughter Tyagi, a former McKinsey consultant, have joined forces here to argue here that the two-parent middle-class working family is on the brink of financial disaster. The number of families declaring bankruptcy or receiving a foreclosure against their house has shot up dramatically. Presenting carefully researched economic data to support their arguments, the authors contend that, contrary to popular myth, families aren't in trouble because they're squandering their second income on luxuries. On the contrary, both incomes are almost entirely committed to necessities, such as home and car payments, health insurance and children's education costs. When an unforeseen event such as serious illness, job loss or divorce occurs, families have no discretionary income to fall back on. The authors recommend a number of useful societal solutions to get families out of this trap, such as legally prohibiting credit card companies from charging grossly unfair interest rates and exposing banks that employ a loan-to-own strategy that steers minority customers to higher mortgage rates with an eye to future foreclosures. Warren and Tyagi point out that families buy homes they cannot afford in order to live in a neighborhood with better schools. Their proposed solution, however-to institute a public school voucher system with wider choice-is less carefully thought out. Overall, however, this is a needed examination of an emerging social problem.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>In the Spirit of St. Barths</h2><p>In spite of an airport runway that&#39;s not for the faint-hearted, St. Barths is synonymous with Caribbean elegance and chic.

By the author of Righteous Pilgrim. TV tie-in. 35,000 first printing. $35,000 ad/promo.</p><p>T.H. Watkins was a well-known environmental writer and historian before his death in 2000. He was a recipient of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize for Biography and was a finalist for the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award. At the time of his death he was Wallace Stegner Distinguished Professor of Western American Studies at Montana State University, and was posthumously awarded the Wallace Stegner Award by the CU-Boulder Center of the American West. He published 28 books and wrote over 300 articles for various publications including National Geographic, Audubon, Smithsonian, the New York Times, and the Washington Post.A discerning, information-packed, and emotionally charged survey of America's crucible; by the author of the National Book Award-nominated Righteous Pilgrim (1990). As might be expected from a companion volume to an upcoming PBS series, the text is episodic and copiously illustrated. By themselves, the more than one hundred photographs and their long, illuminating captions do a fine job of conveying America's dark night. Many are the products of documentary and propaganda efforts by the Resettlement Administration and the Farm Security Administration--New Deal agencies that understood the power of the photograph to shape public opinion. Moving images of Hoovervilles, of the emaciated faces of migrant laborers and their families, and of the bloody conflicts of the union movement, Watkins explains, saturated the public consciousness and helped forge support for the New Deal. Reflecting these photographs by focusing on the human drama of the times, the author traces the era from the financial euphoria that led to the crash of 1929, and shows how the prevailing ethic of the upper classes--who were morally offended at the idea of ``handouts''--tied Hoover's hands long enough for FDR to be swept into office. But even with the ``alphabet soup'' of agencies created by Roosevelt's ``brain trust''--his first hundred days saw more legislation enacted than in any other period in our history--a rebound was a long time coming. Finally, Watkins makes clear, the struggle for economic relief--a struggle that included phenomena like the Bonus Army's march on Washington, the rising popularity of the Communist Party, and the fear of incipient class warfare--resulted in a new conception of government: government that would be a large and constant presence in American lives, promising a degree of security. Heartfelt and wide-ranging, and timely as well, as we continue to grapple with the nurturing sort of government put in place by FDR. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

You are seduced by the literal woman of your dreams, and a turtle assures you that you are an integral part of some secret cosmic plan from the end of time. You're not crazy. Your name is Jesse Aylesworth, and your life as a coed magnet and the editor of the college newspaper is about to spin drastically out of control....<br>It begins when an enigmatic woman named Sully appears out of the swirling snow one winter night and offers Jesse a ride. Then radios and televisions cease functioning. Peculiar events continue to occur with startling frequency. A change of cosmic proportions is coming - one that will both transform Jesse into an immortal, and remake our reality into a universe of eternal life.<br>The Indian, a member of a time-traveling race, has come to recruit candidates for the giant leap through time. Jesse is their only hope for both the future and the past, but before he agrees to aid them, he wants some answers.<br>Who is Sully? Is she manipulating Jesse only to sabotage the Indian's plan, or is she fantasy made flesh - a peasant maiden from the painted landscape of Jesse's dreams come true? Somehow, the fate of all time depends upon how Jesse answers these questions.</p><p>Robert Reed is the author of <i>Marrow</i> and ten other high-concept science fiction novels. A multiple finalist for the Hugo Award, he has had many stories published in major SF magazines, and reprinted in "year's best" anthologies. He lives with his family in Lincoln, Nebraska.<br>Although it begins on a normal-seeming college campus, Reed's latest (following Beyond the Veil of Stars) expands to cover a setting and theme as grand as all the permutations of the galaxy. The plot concerns Jesse Aylesworth, the sexually voracious editor of a college newspaper, whose life of seduction and muckraking is interrupted by the appearance of a strange Indian/Turtle who explains that he has come to offer the gift of eternal life to a select group of vertebrates. His group plans to release humanity from the prison of mortality by turning the universe into an infinite loop in which all possible pasts and futures can occur. The only catch is the unidentified traitor at Jesse's college, someone who wants to pervert the immortals' plans for indubitably heinous reasons. Despite the fact that Jesse's shallow attitudes toward sex aren't fully explained until the book's finale, the book rides far on the strength of Reed's virtuosic, amusingly surreal images of his brave, new, infinitely variable world. And, in an appealingly modest manner, it comes back to earth and an acceptance of the reality we know. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Illustrated Gettysburg Reader: An Eyewitness History of the Civil War?s Greatest Battle</h2><p>One hundred and fifty years after the Battle of Gettysburg, the words of the soldiers and onlookers present for those three fateful days still reverberate with the power of their courage and sacrifice. <i>The Illustrated Gettysburg Reader: An Eyewitness History of the Civil War's Greatest Battle</i> gathers letters, journals, articles and speeches from the people who lived through those legendary three days. Tied together with narrative by historian Rod Gragg and illustrated with a wealth of photographs and images, <i>The Illustrated Gettysburg Reader</i> will transport you to the battlefield, immersing you in the emotional intensity of the struggle of brother against brother for the future of the United States of America.<br><br>"Here they are penetrating the heart of a hostile country leaving their homes beyond broad rivers and the largest of the enemies armies while in front of them is gathering all of resistance that can be obtained by a power fruitful of every element of military power."<br>&#x2014;<i>Confederate soldier T.G.

Robertson Award and other honors, and have been selected for the Book-of-the-Month Club, the History Book Club and the Military History Book Club.July 2013 marks the 150th anniversary of the greatest battle fought on American soil, so one can expect an avalanche of books, articles, and essays that &#x201c;celebrate&#x201d; an anniversary that should more properly be mourned. The photographs provided here are still striking, but most have been seen before. What gives this work power, intimacy, and poignancy is the collection of eyewitness accounts that proceed chronologically from the prelude to the three-day battle that altered the course of the Civil War. A British military observer describes Robert E. Lee in reverential terms, noting his dignity and the devotion of his soldiers. Lee himself writes a letter justifying his risky invasion of the North. A Union soldier speculates that Southern independence might be inevitable. Confederate General James Longstreet recalls his efforts to dissuade Lee from the frontal attack on the Union center. Finally, the climactic charge led by George Pickett is described from multiple perspectives. This is an excellent addition to Civil War collections. --Jay Freeman</p><h2>The Yom Kippur Murder (Christine Bennett)</h2><p>When ex-nun Christine Bennett can&#39;t get into her friend Mr. Herskovitz&#39;s apartment to accompany him to Yom Kippur services, she discovers that he&#39;s been murdered.

Her novels about ex-nun Christine Bennett are in that central range between cozy and hardboiled -- the perfect balance. Ever since I encountered Christine Bennett in THE GOOD FRIDAY MURDER, which was nominated for an Edgar Award as best first novel, I've been fascinated by the author's depiction and development of her heroine -- Christine matures in surprising (but always believeable ways) as the series continues.

Nowhere is this more clear than in her prose poems Tender Buttons. Their repetitive sentences, juxtaposition of sounds, and simple language connote this continuous presence. To live in this state is &#x201c;to begin again and again,&#x201d; to &#x201c;use everything.&#x201d; Each of the three sections, &#x201c;Objects,&#x201d; &#x201c;Food,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Rooms,&#x201d; employs both this repetition and disjointed words to build images. Prose poetry at its most abstract expression, Tender Buttons &#x201c;is to writing...what cubism is to art.&#x201d; (<b>W.G. Rogers</b>)</p></p><p>Gertrude Stein was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, on February 3, 1874, to an affluent Jewish family, spent her early childhood in Vienna and Paris, and later grew up in Oakland, California. At Radcliffe College she studied under William James, who remained her lifelong friend, and then went to Johns Hopkins to study medicine. Abandoning her studies, she moved to Paris with her brother Leo in 1903. At 27 rue de Fleurus, Gertrude Stein lived with Alice B. Toklas, who would remain her companion for forty years. Not only was she an innovator in literature and a supporter of modern poetry and art, she was the friend and mentor of those who visited her at her now-famous home: Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Jean Cocteau, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sherwood Anderson, and Guillaume Appollinaire. Her first important book was <b>Three Lives</b> (1909), then <b>Tender Buttons</b> (1914), followed by her magnum opus, <b>The Making of Americans</b> (1925), and the book which became a huge popular success, <b>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</b> (1933). Just before her death at the age of 72 on July 27, 1946, she asked Alice Toklas from her hospital bed, &#x201c;What is the answer?&#x201d; Getting no answer, she then asked, &#x201c;In that case, what is the question?&#x201d;</p><h2>Dandelion</h2><p>Dandelion overdresses for a come-as-you-are party and is turned away because the hostess does not recognize him.</p><p>Don Freeman was born in San Diego, California, in 1908. At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br> <br> Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Herald Tribune</i>. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br> <br> He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br> <br> Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br> <br> Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including <i>Corduroy</i>, <i>A Pocket for Corduroy</i>, and the Caldecott Honor Book <i>Fly High, Fly Low</i>.</p><h2>Bonjour Tristesse</h2><p><p>Set against the translucent beauty of France in summer, <em>Bonjour Tristesse</em> is a bittersweet tale narrated by C�cile, a seventeen-year-old girl on the brink of womanhood, whose meddling in her father's love life leads to tragic consequences.</p><p>Freed from boarding school, C�cile lives in unchecked enjoyment with her youngish, widowed father -- an affectionate rogue, dissolute and promiscuous.

Throughout her long battle with&nbsp;&nbsp;cancer, Olive Ann Burns worked passionately on a&nbsp;&nbsp;sequel to this magical book. Only during her final&nbsp;&nbsp;days did she realize she wouldn't complete it,&nbsp;&nbsp;dictating from her hospital bed her wishes that the&nbsp;&nbsp;finished chapters be published.<br><br> The result&nbsp;&nbsp;is <i>Leaving Cold Sassy</i> - a&nbsp;&nbsp;portait of the grown-up Will Tweedy; of the feisty&nbsp;&nbsp;young schoolteacher who captures his heart; of the&nbsp;&nbsp;town that has claimed a place in the American&nbsp;&nbsp;imagination; and, in a fascinating reminiscence by her&nbsp;&nbsp;editor, of Olive Ann Burns, a writer who didn't get&nbsp;&nbsp;a chance to finish her extraordinary tale.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete with Olive Ann Burn's notes for later&nbsp;&nbsp;scenes and chapters exactly as she wrote them,&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Leaving Cold Sassy</i> is a final, loving&nbsp;&nbsp;goodbye to Cold Sassy, Georgia.</p><p>In 1984, the late Burns (d. 1990) published Cold Sassy Tree--a spirited, southern small-town rural tale with robust characters and a regional period (1906) diction that was as tangy and real as grits. Now comes this partial sequel--which continues the story of Will Tweedy and the courting of his future wife--that Burns, with extraordinary courage, worked on through her final illness. Burns's editor, Katrina Kenison, who was left with notes and letters by the author to indicate plotlines beyond the 15 finished chapters here, has contributed a tribute and personal reminiscence. The previous novel concerned the adventures of narrator Will Tweedy, then 14, of Cold Sassy Tree, Georgia, who among others wondered at the shocking marriage of newly widowed Grandpa Blakeslee and the stylish Miss Love. Now, in 1917, Grandpa is gone, and boarding with Miss Love is that ``pure-T beauty,'' new schoolteacher Sanna Maria Klein, who's infatuated with a Harvard boy--until her disastrous visit to his fancy home when bath water floods a festive board. Will's courting moves on--even through a Thanksgiving when Sanna's usually genial foster-father, snookered on moonshine, saws a half moon out of the dining-room table to accommodate his massive stomach--but there are seeds of trouble even before the wedding: Will, a county agent for the state's Department of Agriculture, speaks of farming's gamble as ``excitin','' Sanna says, ``I hate excitement...just another word for worry.'' Meanwhile, most of the Cold Sassy Tree cast is here again: abrasive Aunt Loma, who can whistle ``Whispering Hope'' so thrillingly at church but who has crazy marriage plans, as well as a mean deal for her son; Will's parents, yoked but apart; and townsfolk who have the stubborn endurance of hardscrabble lives beyond their salty talk. For fans of Cold Sassy Tree, an essential; for newcomers, a spur to read the earlier novel. Kenison's tribute to Burns, a gentle, gallant woman, comprises half of the book. (Eight-page photo insert) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>When her long and valiant fight against cancer and congestive heart failure came to an end, Burns's last wish was that the finished chapters of the sequel to Cold Sassy Tree ( LJ 10/15/84) might reach her many faithful readers in published form. Leaving Cold Sassy honors that wish, but it represents an act of homage rather than a finished work of fiction. The extant 15 chapters are obviously in need of tightening and polishing, and the reader must depend on the editor's notes to learn of Burns's plans for the novel; the actual text barely introduces the story. Burns intended to tell, again in Will Tweedy's (her father's) voice, the fictionalized story of her parents' marriage--sorely tried by Depression poverty, incompatibility, and her father's infidelities, yet finally successful. Fans of Cold Sassy Tree will enjoy the affectionate recollections of Burns's editor and friend, which constitute one third of the text.

At the dawn of the new century, Ken Lay&#x2019;s and Jeff Skilling's faces graced the covers of business magazines, and Enron&#x2019;s money oiled the political machinery behind George W. Bush&#x2019;s election campaign. But as Wall Street analysts sang Enron&#x2019;s praises, and its stock spiraled dizzyingly into the stratosphere, the company&#x2019;s leaders were madly scrambling to manufacture illusory profits, hide its ballooning debt, and bully Wall Street into buying its fictional accounting and off-balance-sheet investment vehicles. The story of Enron&#x2019;s fall is a morality tale writ large, performed on a stage with an unforgettable array of props and side plots, from parking lots overflowing with Boxsters and BMWs to hot-house office affairs and executive tantrums.<br> <br>Among the cast of characters Mimi Swartz and Sherron Watkins observe with shrewd Texas eyes and an insider&#x2019;s perspective are: CEO Ken Lay, Enron&#x2019;s &#x201c;outside face,&#x201d; who was more interested in playing diplomat and paving the road to a political career than in managing Enron&#x2019;s high-testosterone, anything-goes culture; Jeff Skilling, the mastermind behind Enron&#x2019;s mercenary trading culture, who transformed himself from a nerdy executive into the personification of millennial cool; Rebecca Mark, the savvy and seductive head of Enron&#x2019;s international division, who was Skilling&#x2019;s sole rival to take over the company; and Andy Fastow, whose childish pranks early in his career gave way to something far more destructive. Desperate to be a player in Enron&#x2019;s deal-making, trader-oriented culture, Fastow transformed Enron&#x2019;s finance department into a &#x201c;profit center,&#x201d; creating a honeycomb of financial entities to bolster Enron&#x2019;s &#x201c;profits,&#x201d; while diverting tens of millions of dollars into his own pockets<br><br>An unprecedented chronicle of Enron&#x2019;s shocking collapse, <i>Power Failure</i> should take its place alongside the classics of previous decades &#x2013; <i>Barbarians at the Gate</i> and <i>Liar&#x2019;s Poker</i> &#x2013; as one of the cautionary tales of our times.</p><p>Something strange happened to the Enron Corporation in the early 1990s: It went from a company that traded in tangible goods to one that dealt in pure abstractions, with shoddy accounting practices, astonishing compensation packages, and smoke and mirrors to obfuscate this new reality.<p> Company auditors, Sherron Watkins among them, warned top Enron execs from CEO Kenneth Lay on down that the company&#x2019;s increasing reliance on cooked books and phony reports "will implode in a wave of accounting scandals." As anyone who played the stock market or watched Enron suits do the perp walk on the evening news a couple of years ago will remember, that&#x2019;s exactly what happened. <i>Texas Monthly</i> editor Swarz and Watkins team up to offer this account, rich in anecdote and numbers alike, of what went wrong and who made it so.

Wade to the present</p><p>This book brings a human dimension to the debate about a woman's right to choose. Bonavoglia's interviews with 25 well-known people (mostly women, including Rite Moreno, Margot Kidder, Whoopi Goldberg, Grace Paley, Ursula LeGuin, Elizabeth Janeway) show that the decision to abort is never taken lightly and that it should be made privately, without government interference. The courage of those interviewed--who sought illegal abortions or helped others obtain them, chose to terminate pregnancies resulting from rape, and faced the possibility of bearing children with birth defects--is evident. They demonstrate a strong belief in the right to choose. Most had children when they were ready. Unlike Laurence Tribe's legal examination in Abortion: The Clash of Absolutes ( LJ 6/15/90), this book makes real the experience of abortion.

Paris in the twenties: Pernod, parties and expatriate Americans, loose-living on money from home. Jake is wildly in love with Brett Ashley, aristocratic and irresistibly beautiful, with an abandoned, sensuous nature that she cannot change. When the couple drift to Spain to the dazzle of the fiesta and the heady atmosphere of the Bullfight, their affair is strained by new passions, new jealousies, and Jake must finally learn that he will never possess the woman that he loves.</p><p><i>The Sun Also Rises</i> first appeared in 1926, and yet it's as fresh and clean and fine as it ever was, maybe finer. Hemingway's famously plain declarative sentences linger in the mind like poetry: "Brett was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy's. She started all that." His cast of thirtysomething dissolute expatriates--Brett and her drunken fianc�, Mike Campbell, the unhappy Princeton Jewish boxer Robert Cohn, the sardonic novelist Bill Gorton--are as familiar as the "cool crowd" we all once knew. No wonder this quintessential lost-generation novel has inspired several generations of imitators, in style as well as lifestyle.<p> Jake Barnes, Hemingway's narrator with a mysterious war wound that has left him sexually incapable, is the heart and soul of the book. Brett, the beautiful, doomed English woman he adores, provides the glamour of natural chic and sexual unattainability. Alcohol and post-World War I anomie fuel the plot: weary of drinking and dancing in Paris caf�s, the expatriate gang decamps for the Spanish town of Pamplona for the "wonderful nightmare" of a week-long fiesta. Brett, with fianc� and ex-lover Cohn in tow, breaks hearts all around until she falls, briefly, for the handsome teenage bullfighter Pedro Romero. "My God! he's a lovely boy," she tells Jake. "And how I would love to see him get into those clothes. He must use a shoe-horn." Whereupon the party disbands.</p><p> But what's most shocking about the book is its lean, adjective-free style. <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> is Hemingway's masterpiece--one of them, anyway--and no matter how many times you've read it or how you feel about the manners and morals of the characters, you won't be able to resist its spell. This is a classic that really does live up to its reputation. <i>--David Laskin</i></p>7 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Designer Techniques Couture Tips For Home Sewing</h2><p>Provides detailed instructions on designer sewing and creating home furnishings, including choosing fabrics, equipment and tools, patterns, and tips on each project</p><p>King, host of the PBS series Sewing Today, here offers his resource guide for the home sewer who wishes to add couture touches to clothing and home decor items.

The myth of female beauty challenges every woman, every day of her life. The author exposes the tyranny of the beauty myth through the ages and its oppressive function today, in the home and at work, in literature and the media, in relationships between men and women, between women and women. With examples, she confronts the beauty industry and its advertising and uncovers the reasons why women are consumed by this destructive obsession.</p><p>In a country where the average woman is 5-foot-4 and weighs 140 pounds, movies, advertisements, and MTV saturate our lives with unrealistic images of beauty. The tall, nearly emaciated mannequins that push the latest miracle cosmetic make even the most confident woman question her appearance. Feminist Naomi Wolf argues that women&#39;s insecurities are heightened by these images, then exploited by the diet, cosmetic, and plastic surgery industries. Every day new products are introduced to &#34;correct&#34; inherently female &#34;flaws,&#34; drawing women into an obsessive and hopeless cycle built around the attempt to reach an impossible standard of beauty. Wolf rejects the standard and embraces the naturally distinct beauty of all women.Explores the phenomenon of the violent backlash against feminism that uses images of female beauty as a political weapon against women's advancement.<p> "<i>The Beauty Myth</i> is a smart, angry, insightful book, and a clarion call to freedom. Every woman should read it." -- Gloria Steinem.</p></p><h2>Beowulf: A New Prose Translation</h2><p><p><strong>This book is a highly accurate, new prose translation of the classic Anglo-Saxon poem, Beowulf.</strong></p> The greatest and most important of the Anglo-Saxon epic poems, the 1200-year-old <em>Beowulf</em> is one of the earliest pieces of literature in the English language. Though in English, the story is set in Scandinavia, where the Anglo-Saxon races lived before migration to England. It tells of the hero, Beowulf, who kills the monster Grendel after the dragonlike beast terrorizes the mead-halls, carrying off and eating the Thanes that are under Beowulf's protection. Fascinating for its story, the echoes of myth and early religion, Beowulf is critical reading for anyone interested in the blend of the Pagan and Christian traditions among the Anglo-Saxons.

By applying ingeniously simple lessons learned from the Pike Place, our manager discovers how to energise and transform her workplace. Addressing today&#39;s most pressing work issues with an engaging metaphor and an appealing message, FISH! offers wisdom that is easy to grasp, instantly applicable, and profound.</p><p>Here's another management parable that draws its lesson from an unlikely source--this time it's the fun-loving fishmongers at Seattle's Pike Place Market. In <i>Fish!</i> the heroine, Mary Jane Ramirez, recently widowed and mother of two, is asked to engineer a turnaround of her company's troubled operations department, a group that authors Stephen Lundin, Harry Paul, and John Christensen describe as a "toxic energy dump." Most reasonable heads would cut their losses and move on. Why bother with this bunch of losers? But the authors don't make it so easy for Mary Jane. Instead, she's left to sort out this mess with the help of head fishmonger Lonnie. Based on a bestselling corporate education video, <i>Fish!</i> aims to help employees find their way to a fun and happy workplace. While some may find the story line and prescriptions--such as "Choose Your Attitude," "Make Their Day," and "Be Present"--downright corny, others will find a good dose of worthwhile motivational management techniques. If you loved <i>Who Moved My Cheese?</i> then you'll find much to like here. And don't worry about Mary Jane and kids. <i>Fish!</i> has a happy ending for everyone. <i>--Harry C. Edwards</i>Stephen Lundin is a filmmaker and professional speaker. Harry Paul is senior vice president with The Ken Blanchard Companies. John Christensen produces corporate learning films, including the Fish! video.</p><h2>The Grateful Dead Reader (Readers on American Musicians)</h2><p>Here is an exciting collection of writings about The Grateful Dead, offering both classic and hard-to-find essays, reporting, and reviews.<br> Arranged in chronological order, these pieces add up to nothing less than a full-scale history of the group--from Tom Wolfe's account of the Dead's first performance (at an Acid Test in 1965), to Ralph Gleason's 1967 interview with the 24-year-old Jerry Garcia, to Mary Eisenhart's obituary of the great guitarist. Powerful, incisive, and always imaginative, these selections include not only outstanding writing on the Grateful Dead, but also superb pieces on music and pop culture generally. And alongside the words of Tom Wolfe, George W.S. Trow, and Robert Christgau, readers will find poetry, fiction, drawings, and an offering of rare and revealing photographs. Fans will be fascinated by this anthology's many interviews and profiles, interpretations of lyrics, and concert and record reviews. Yet The Grateful Dead was more than a band--it was a cultural phenomenon. For three decades it remained on one unending tour, followed everywhere by a small army of nomadic fans who constituted a virtual cult. The writers in <em>The Grateful Dead Reader</em> both celebrate and analyze this phenomenon, in such pieces as Ed McClanahan's groundbreaking article in <em>Playboy</em> in 1972, fan-magazine editor Blair Jackson's 1990 essay on the seriousness of the drug situation at Dead concerts, and Steve Silberman's insightful essays on the music and its fans. <br> <em>The Grateful Dead Reader</em> brims with some of the best writing on music, on popular culture, and on a band that helped define a generation.<br></p><p><br><strong>David G. Dodd</strong> and <strong>Diana Spaulding</strong> are a husband-and-wife editorial team. David co-edited (with Robert Weiner) the definitive Grateful Dead bibliography, <em>The Grateful Dead and Deadheads</em>. He also maintains the Annotated Grateful Dead Lyrics site on the Internet. Diana is a Project Manager for the CARL Corporation. They live in Petaluma, California.<br>What a Long, Strange Trip It Was: a comprehensive, thoughtful anthology depicting the phenomena and foibles encompassing the 30-odd year unending tour of the Grateful Dead.Husband-and-wife editors Dodd (The Grateful Dead and Deadheads, not reviewed) and Spaulding shrewdly cast a wide net in addressing the Deadhead phenomenon, and the plurality of perspectives and information helps even neophytes understand the band's tenacity in outlasting the Haight-Ashbury days, their development as an underground phenomenon, and their dedication to musical experimentation (as reflected in everything from idiosyncratic side projects to their obsession with live sound and encouragement of tape trading among their hardcore fans). Though these pieces do not dispel a conception of this Deadhead subculture as solipsistic and clubbish, there's much fine writing here nonetheless. Key pieces include Tom Wolfe's account of an early Kool-Aid Acid Test, essays on the Dead's beginnings by pioneering pop journalist Ralph Gleason, and accounts of the 1970-era period (when it became evident the band had evolved beyond being a mere California rock group into something more unpredictably fluid) by Steve Silberman, George W.S. Trow, and novelist Ed McClanahan. While contributors like Silberman, Mary Eisenhart, and Blair Jackson are connected within the Dead organization (and, to their credit, find insiders' insights), the rock critical establishment is represented by short, lively pieces from Robert Christgau and Richard Meltzer, as well as writers not associated with the Dead's milieu (like screenwriter Charlie Haas and fiction writer Lee Abbott). Substantial interviews with key Dead members Jerry Garcia, Phil Lesh, and lyricist Robert Hunter also appear. While many pieces hew to depictions of the Dead-related lifestyle as an elaborate traveling utopia, fan-magazine editor Jackson portrays darker qualities in his 1990 depiction of a scene consumed by both overindulgence and undercover drug warriors looking for easy prosecutions.Although the book ends abruptly with saddened consideration of Garcia's 1995 demise (without discussing the Dead's influence upon current cultish, touring jam bands), it remains a satisfying and thought-provoking compendium of countercultural commentary. -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

As Eugene Peterson writes, this book "gives us a language adequate for responding to the God who speaks to us."<br><br>Translated directly from the original Hebrew, the Psalms come alive in the heart-stirring words of The Message.</p><p>EUGENE H. PETERSON is a writer and poet. He has authored more than twenty books and is a contributing editor to Leadership Journal. He is Professor Emeritus of Spiritual Theology at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia. Eugene was also the founding pastor of Christ Our King Presbyterian Church in Bel Air, Maryland, where he ministered for twenty-nine years.The writer, whose The Message: The New Testament in Contemporary English (NavPress, 1993) is a paraphrase of the New Testament, now applies the same method to the Old Testament book of Psalms. In a few places, the technique works; some of the rougher passages recover their harshness in the contemporary idiom, and the act of paraphrasing itself underscores the devotional value of putting the Psalms in one's own words. But too often Peterson uses paraphrase for its own sake, as when Psalm 19 turns "gold" and "honey" into "diamonds" and "strawberries," as though the former terms were unclear to the reader. He also imposes Christian categories on what is patently a Hebrew text. The writer's lack of skill at reproducing the poetry of the Psalms is evident everywhere; Stephen Mitchell's A Book of Psalms (LJ 6/1/93) is far preferable to this volume. The whole endeavor makes one understand why some people long for the days of the King James version. A marginal purchase.<br><i>W.

His tale runs from the Garden of Eden, when God realizes he has forgotten to give Adam and Eve the gift of speech, to the moment when Noah&#x2019;s Ark lands on the dry peak of Ararat. Cain, the despised, the murderer, is Saramago&#x2019;s protagonist. </p><p>Condemned to wander forever after he kills his brother Abel, Cain makes his way through the world in the company of a personable donkey. He is a witness to and participant in the stories of Isaac and Abraham, the destruction of the Tower of Babel, Moses and the golden calf, the trials of Job. The rapacious Queen Lilith takes him as her lover. An old man with two sheep on a rope crosses his path. And again and again, Cain encounters a God whose actions seem callous, cruel, and unjust. He confronts Him, he argues with Him. &#x201c;And one thing we know for certain,&#x201d; Saramago writes, &#x201c;is that they continued to argue and are arguing still.&#x201d; </p><p>A startling book&#x2014;sensual, funny&#x2014;in all ways a fitting end to Saramago&#x2019;s extraordinary career. <br></p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2011:</strong> In his final slim novel, the late Jos� Saramago gives a cheeky modernist update to a timeworn biblical tale. After killing his brother Abel in an exasperated rage, Cain makes a deal with a CEO-like God and escapes with little more than a donkey and a few snacks, doomed to nomadic immortality. As he wanders through time and space, the handsome itinerant interferes with the dealings of a familiar cast of characters--Noah, Moses, Isaac--forever altering the course of legend along the way. Deeply flawed and all too human, despite the eternal life granted him, Cain also struggles openly with the idea of faith in the face of an equally flawed God. By turns philosophical and hilarious, <em>Cain</em> shows off the scope of Saramago&#x2019;s talent and makes a fitting coda for a superlative writing life. <em>--Mia Lipman</em>HMH Hardcover, 2011Previous ISBN: 978-0-547-48334-4</p><h2>Still Shining Discovering!

In <em>Flaubert in the Ruins of Paris</em>, Peter Brooks examines why Flaubert thought his recently published novel, <em>Sentimental Education</em>, was prophetic of the upheavals in France during this "terrible year," and how Flaubert's life and that of his compatriots were changed forever.<br><br>Brooks uses letters between Flaubert and his novelist friend and confidante George Sand to tell the story of Flaubert and his work, exploring his political commitments and his understanding of war, occupation, insurrection, and bloody political repression. Interweaving history, art history, and literary criticism-from Flaubert's magnificent novel of historical despair, to the building of the reactionary monument the Sacr�-Coeur on Paris's highest summit, to the emergence of photography as historical witness-Brooks sheds new light on the pivotal moment when France redefined herself for the modern world.<br></p><p><b>Peter Brooks</b> is Sterling Professor Emeritus of Comparative Literature at Yale University.

The emotional intensity of this portrait is riveting.</p><p>Colm T�ib�n is the author of seven novels, including <i>The Master</i>, winner of the Los Angeles Times Book Prize; <i>Brooklyn</i>, winner of the Costa Book Award; <i>The Testament of Mary</i>, and <i>Nora Webster</i>, as well as two story collections.

He had watched how men in England generally respected their own habits until those around them learned to follow suit. He knew men who did not rise until noon, or who slept in a chair each afternoon, or who ate beef for breakfast, and he noticed how these customs became part of the household routine and were scarcely commented on. His habits, of course, were sociable and, in the main, easy; his inclinations were civil and his idiosyncrasies mild. Thus it had become convenient to himself and simple to explain to others that he should turn down invitations, confess himself busy, overworked, engaged both day and night in his art. His time as an inveterate dinner guest in the great London houses had, he hoped, come to an end. </p><p> He loved the glorious silence a morning brought, knowing that he had no appointments that afternoon and no engagements that evening. He had grown fat on solitude, he thought, and had learned to expect nothing from the day but at best a dull contentment. Sometimes the dullness came to the fore with a strange and insistent ache which he would entertain briefly, but learn to keep at bay. Mostly, however, it was the contentment he entertained; the slow ease and the silence could, once night had fallen, fill him with a happiness that nothing, no society nor the company of any individual, no glamour or glitter, could equal. </p><p> In these days after his opening night and his return from Ireland he discovered that he could control the sadness which certain memories brought with them. When sorrows and fears and terrors came to him in the time after he woke, or in the night, they were like servants come to light a lamp or take away a tray. Carefully trained over years, they would soon disappear of their own accord, knowing not to linger. </p><p> Nonetheless, he remembered the shock and the shame of the opening night of <i>Guy Domville.</i> He told himself that the memory would fade, and with that admonition he tried to put all thoughts of his failure out of his mind. </p><p> Instead, he thought about money, going over amounts he had received and amounts due; he thought of travel, where he would go and when. He thought of work, ideas and characters, moments of clarity. He controlled these thoughts, he knew that they were like candles leading him through the dark. They could easily, if he did not concentrate, be snuffed out and he would again be pondering defeats and disappointments, which if not managed could lead to thoughts that left him desperate and afraid. </p><p> He woke early sometimes and when such thoughts took over, he knew that he had no choice but to rise. By operating decisively, as though he were rushing somewhere, as though the train were on time and he was late, he believed that he could banish them. </p><p> Nonetheless, he knew that he had to allow his mind its freedoms. He lived on the randomness of the mind's workings, and, now, as the day began, he found himself involved in a new set of musings and imaginings. He wondered how an idea could so easily change shape and appear fresh in a new guise; he did not know how close to the surface this story had been lurking. It was a simple tale, made simpler still by his friend Benson's father, the archbishop of Canterbury, who had tried to entertain him one evening after the failure of his play. He had hesitated too much and stopped too often as he attempted to tell a ghost story, knowing neither the middle nor the end and unsure even of the contours of the beginning. </p><p> Henry had set it down as soon as he arrived home. He wrote in his notebook: "Note here the ghost story told me at Addington (evening of Thursday 10th), by the archbishop of Canterbury: the mere vague, undetailed, faint sketch of it: the story of the young children (indefinite number and age), left to the care of servants in an old country house, through the death, presumably, of parents. The servants, wicked and depraved, corrupt and deprave the children: the children are bad, full of evil to a sinister degree. The servants die (the story vague about the way of it) and their apparitions return to haunt the house and children." </p><p> He did not need to look back at his notebook to be reminded of the story; the events remained with him. He thought of setting it in Newport, in a remote house by the rocks, or in one of the newer mansions in New York, but none of these settings captured him, and gradually he abandoned the idea of an American family. It became an English story set in the past; and in the early and slow elaboration of the story he reduced the children to merely two, a boy and his younger sister. </p><p> He thought often of the death of his sister Alice, who had died three years earlier. He had read her diaries, so full of indiscretions, for the first time. Now he felt alone, much as she had throughout her life, and he felt close to her, although he never suffered her symptoms or maladies and lacked her stoicism and her acceptance. </p><p> In his darkest hours, he felt that both of them had somehow been abandoned as their family toured Europe and returned, often for no reason, to America. They had never been fully included in the passion of events and places, becoming watchers and nonparticipants. Their brother William, the eldest, and then Wilky and Bob, who came between Henry and Alice, had been ready for the world, expertly molded, while Henry and Alice had been left unprotected and unready. He had become a writer and she had taken to her bed. </p><p> He could clearly remember the first time he sensed Alice's panic. They had been caught in the rain in Newport, having become too distracted by their own talk and laughter to pay attention to the darkening of the sky. She could have been fourteen or fifteen, but she had developed none of the strange, shy assurance of her cousins when they came to that age; their poised and careful way of coming into a room, or talking to a stranger, their easy and spontaneous way of being with friends and family, all this confidence Alice lacked. </p><p> It began to rain hard that hot summer's day and the sky over the sea was a purple-gray mass of cloud. He was wearing a light jacket, but Alice was wearing only a summer dress and a flimsy straw hat. There was no shelter at hand. A few times they tried to shelter under bushes but the rain, driven by the wind, was insistent. He took off his jacket and held it over both of them and they moved slowly and silently, huddled close together, towards home. He sensed her happiness as intense, almost shrill. He had never before understood the extent of her need for the full attention, the full pity and protection, of him or William or their parents. In these minutes, as they walked the wet sandy soil of the lane from the sea walk back to the village, he felt his sister on fire with satisfaction at being close to him. Watching her radiance and delight as they neared home, he had his first sense of how difficult things were going to be for her. </p><p> He began to watch her. Until now, he had considered the joke that William was going to marry her as a light tease, a way to make her smile and William laugh and all the family join in. It was also a show put on for visitors. William, the eldest, was six years older than Alice. As soon as Alice began to present herself to visitors, wear colorful dresses and become alert to the effect she could have on a roomful of adults, the joke that she was going to marry William became a kind of ritual. </p><p> "Oh, she's going to marry William," Aunt Kate would say, and if William were there, he would come over to her, take her arm, kiss her on the cheek. And she would say nothing, merely watch everybody, her eyes almost hostile before their smiles and laughter. Her father would lift her and hug her. </p><p> "Oh, it won't be long now," he would say. </p><p> Alice, Henry thought, never believed that she was going to marry William. She was rational and even when she was in her teens her intelligence had at its core a brittle anger. Yet because the idea that she would marry William had been spoken so many times, and because no outsider had presented himself as even vaguely plausible, the notion had entered surreptitiously but firmly into the silent places of her soul. </p><p> As he pondered and tried to shape the story of the two abandoned children told to him by the archbishop, he found himself thinking about his sister's puzzling presence in the world. He went over the scenes where she had made clear to them her considerable intelligence and her raw vulnerability. She was the only little girl he had ever known, and now, as he began to imagine a little girl, it was his sister's unquiet ghost which came to him. </p><p> He remembered a scene when Alice must have been sixteen. It was one of those long dinners with one or two guests, he remembered, and someone was talking about life after death, and meeting members of their family after death, or hoping to, or believing they might. Then one of the guests, or Aunt Kate, had suggested praying to meet the loved ones in the next life, when suddenly Alice's voice rose above all others and everyone stopped and looked at her. </p><p> "One need pray for nothing," she said. "Reference to those whom we should meet again makes me shiver. It is an invasion of their sanctity. It is the sort of personal claim to which I am deeply opposed." </p><p> She had sounded like Emerson's aunt, someone steeped in the philosophy of life and death, someone who prided herself on the independence of her thought. It was clear to her family that she had a sharp mind and a great wit but that she knew that she would have to conceal them if she wanted to be like the other young women of her age. </p><p> Alice had friends and visitors and went on outings. She learned to be acceptable to the sisters of her brothers' associates. But Henry observed her when a young man came into the room and he noticed the change in her behavior. She could not relax and her silences were full of force. She would become garrulous, talking a mixture of nonsense and paradox.

The light fell over a hand&#x2014;narrow, slender, without the affectation of rings or polish. Yet even bare, it remained an essentially feminine hand, the kind that could be pictured holding a porcelain cup or waving a feather fan.

A substantial number of his poems, however, have hitherto remained uncollected, and often elusive - poems published in newspapers, magazines, and journals, as well as in private or limited editions. Uncollected Poems - published to mark the centenary of Thomas&#39; birth - brings together for the first time a rigorous selection of the best of these. Spanning the whole of Thomas&#39; career, from an early sonnet to his first wife, M.E. Eldridge, to poems which are powerful expressions of the metaphysical meditations of his later years. It gives readers of R.S. Thomas&#39; work access to much new and fascinating material.</p><p>R.S. Thomas (1913-2000) is one of the major poets of our time, as well as one of the finest religious poets in the English language and Wales&#39;s greatest poet. He published over 50 books of poetry and prose. Most of his poems from his first 50 years of writing are in Collected Poems 1945-1990 (Phoenix Press), while the poems from his last five collections are included in Collected Later Poems (2004) from Bloodaxe. His Penguin Selected Poems is a curious selection drawing on both his Collecteds. His Uncollected Poems, edited by Tony Brown and Jason Walford Davies (Bloodaxe Books, 2013), selects previously published but uncollected poems included in none of his other published books. Born in Cardiff, the son of a sea captain, he moved with his family in 1918 to Holyhead on Anglesey. He was awarded a bursary in 1932 to study at the University College of North Wales, Bangor, where he read Classics. In 1936, having completed his theological training at St. Michael&#39;s College, Llandaff, he was ordained as a priest in the Church in Wales. From 1936 to 1940 he was the curate of Chirk, Denbighshire, where he met his future wife, Mildred (Elsi) Eldridge, an English artist. He subsequently became curate at Tallarn Green, Flintshire. They married in 1940 and remained together until her death in 1991. He married his second wife Betty in 1996. From 1942 to 1954 Thomas was rector at Manafon, in rural Montgomeryshire. It was during his time at Manafon that he first began to study Welsh and that he published his first three volumes of poetry. He learnt the Welsh language at the age of 30, too late in life, he said, to be able to write poetry in it, although he did write and publish memoirs in Welsh. In his later years he worked in predominantly Welsh-speaking communities at Eglwys-fach and Aberdaron. He retired from the Church in 1978, and afterwards lived on Anglesey. He won several awards, including the Queen&#39;s Gold Medal for Poetry in 1964. In 1996 he won the Lannan Lifetime Achievement Award for Poetry and the Horst Bienek Prize for Poetry. He was also nominated for the 1996 Nobel Prize in Literature (awarded to Seamus Heaney).&#39;Gathered in from far and wide, and chronicling sixty years of austere devotion to language, these poems remind us that brevity was for R.S. Thomas ever the soul of passion, and unnerving honesty his guarantor of truth. Bitter elegies for the &#34;botched land&#34; of Wales and baffled encounters with &#34;the incorrigibly human&#34; here keep company with jeremiads for his civilisation and the sound of one hand clapping for his God. But, most touchingly for this laureate of loneliness, there are also occasional gentle, shy poems of love, even in old age: &#34;Come to me a moment, stand,/ Ageing yet lovely still,/ At my side...&#39; - Professor M. Wynn Thomas. &#39;Like Yeats, Thomas has produced his most powerful work in his old age - reminds me of Beethoven&#39;s last quartets in its fearless exploration of the mysteries of life and death - He is the first great poet since the Metaphysicals of the 17th century to draw his images from the science of his day&#39; - Denis Healey. &#39;Reading R.S. Thomas&#39;s poems has become like reading the prophet Jeremiah - we find the same tenacity of theme and purpose; the ability to look without blinking into the misuse of the raw material of humanity&#39; - David Scott.</p><h2>Henry and Beezus (Henry Huggins)</h2><p>children</p><p><p>Old friends, new adventures!</p><p>Henry Huggins is saving up for the bicycle of his dreams, but his plans to earn money don't quite work out as he'd hoped.

Her mother arranged with the State Library to have books sent to Yamhill and acted as librarian in a lodge room upstairs over a bank. There Mrs. Cleary learned to love books. When the family moved to Portland, where Mrs. Cleary attended grammar school and high school, she soon found herself in the low reading circle, an experience that has given her sympathy for the problems of struggling readers. By the third grade she had conquered reading and spent much of her childhood either with books or on her way to and from the public library. Before long her school librarian was suggesting that she should write for boys and girls when she grew up. The idea appealed to her, and she decided that someday she would write the books she longed to read but was unable to find on the library shelves, funny stories about her neighborhood and the sort of children she knew. <p>After graduation from junior college in Ontario, California, and the University of California at Berkeley, Mrs. Cleary entered the School of Librarianship at the University of Washington, Seattle. There she specialized in library work with children. She was Children's Librarian in Yakima, Washington, until she married Clarence Cleary and moved to California. The Clearys are the parents of twins, now grown. Mrs. Cleary's hobbies are travel and needlework. </p><p>Mrs. Cleary's books have earned her many prestigious awards, including the 1984 John Newbery Medal for <i>Dear Mr. Henshaw,</i> for the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children in 1983. Her <i>Ramona and Her Father</i> and <i>Ramona Quimby, Age 8</i> were named 1978 and 1982 Newbery Honor Books, respectively. Among Mrs. Cleary's other awards are the American Library Association's 1975 Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, the Catholic Library Association's 1980 Regina Medal, and the University of Southern Mississippi's 1982 Silver Medallion, all presented in recognition of her lasting contribution to children's literature. In addition, Mrs. Cleary was the 1984 United States author nominee for the Hans Christian Andersen Award, a prestigious international award. Equally important are the more than 35 statewide awards Mrs. Cleary's books have received based on the direct votes of her young readers. The Beverly Cleary Sculpture Garden for Children, featuring bronze statues of Ramona Quimby, Henry Huggins, and Ribsy, was recently opened in Portland, Oregon. </p><p>This witty and warm author is truly an international favorite. Mrs. Cleary's books appear in over twenty countries in fourteen languages and her characters, including Henry Huggins, Ellen Tebbits, Otis Spofford, and Beezus and Ramona Quimby, as well as Ribsy, Socks, and Ralph S. Mouse, have delighted children for generations. There have been Japanese, Spanish, and Swedish television programs based on the Henry Huggins series. PBS-TV aired a ten-part series based on the Ramona stories. One-hour adaptations of the three Ralph S. Mouse books have been shown on ABC-TV. All of Mrs. Cleary's adaptations still can be seen on cable television, and the Ramona adaptations are available in video stores.</p><p></p></p><h2>Learning to Fly</h2><p>Penguins can t fly.

More than 200 Curious George titles followed, with 75 million books sold&nbsp;worldwide. Curious George has been successfully adapted into a major motion picture and an Emmy-winning television show on&nbsp;PBS.<br> &nbsp;</p><br><br>The Reys were born in Hamburg, Germany. <b>Hans Augusto Rey</b> (1898-1977) met his wife-to-be, <b>Margret</b> (1906-1996), at a party in her father&#x2019;s home in Germany; when he first caught a glimpse of her, she was sliding down the banister. In their twenties and thirties they lived in Paris and in Rio de Janeiro, where Hans sold bathtubs in villages along the Amazon River. Eventually Cambridge, Massachusetts, became the Reys&#x2019; home and community. Throughout their lives the Reys created many lively books together, including SPOTTY, PRETZEL, and lift-the-flap books such as HOW DO YOU GET THERE? The manuscript of the first Curious George books was one of the few items the Reys carried with them on their bicycles when they escaped from Paris in 1940. Eventually, they made their way to the United States, and CURIOUS GEORGE was published in 1941. Their incorrigible little monkey has become an American icon, selling millions of books and capturing the hearts of readers everywhere. CURIOUS GEORGE has been published in many languages, including French, German, Japanese, Afrikaans, and Norwegian. Additional Curious George books followed, as well as such other favorites as CECILY G. AND THE NINE MONKEYS and FIND THE CONSTELLATIONS.

From earliest days to 1948, it has passed from one ruler to another, one empire to the next, and has been a melting-pot for a wide range of cultures and beliefs. With sites sacred to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, the Holy Land and its people have had an impact on history out of all proportion to its size - and continue to do so today. The Story of the Holy Land is a short but authoritative overview of this fascinating story. Richly illustrated with superb photography, including original nineteenth and twentieth century shots from the �cole Biblique in Jerusalem, this book will take you on a journey lasting nearly 4000 years.

It certainly won&#39;t be the last. Mang Ambo is the first book only because it is Larry&#39;s comic strip whose originals he has kept...The reader will find Mang Ambo not only funny but full of wisdom. He is a sabungero, a cockfight aficionado, with the inevitable kerchief tied around his head. He lives with his fat wife Orang in Barrio Bulabog, which can be any barrio in the Philippines. He and his barrio folk speak English because the magazines in which they were originally published...were in English. The situations he gets himself into, however, are as true as today as they were more than 20 years ago when the comic strips were first published. Larry looks at the foibles of society and makes fun of them through the cartoons for all to see--like holding up a mirror for society to see itself as it is, warts and all. - Neal Cruz, Executive Editor, Daily Globe</p><p></p><h2>Michelangelo&#39;s Notebook</h2><p>Life may imitate art...but death follows it. <p></p>While studying art history at New York University, brilliant and beautiful Finn Ryan makes a startling discovery: a Michelangelo drawing of a dissected corpse-supposedly from the artist's near-mythical notebook.

Hardcover with dustjacket, 1st edition. Collection of short stories by the African American poet and author, who was shot to death by a New York City Transit police officer in 1968 at the age of 33.</p><p>These excellent short stories will introduce the late Dumas, who was killed in 1968 at the age of 33 by a New York City transit police officer, to a wider audience as a profoundly gifted and intelligent author. His settings range from the small towns of the rural South to the explosive streets of Harlem in the late 1960s. The civil rights activist imbues his stories with myth and folklore, rightful anger and delineations of the inequities that exist for blacks in America. The author's invocation of the ethos of his people lends an honesty to the writings on racial tensions, yet never lapses into narrow-mindedness, and his trenchant rendering of pain, love, religious and family life is universally appealing. His rhythmic, eloquent style is both arresting and unique in its capacity to drive home the prophetic messages that inform his prose. From the young Southern boy named Fish-hound in the eerie "Ark of Bones"who is told by an old Noah-like man, "Son, you are in the house of generations. Every African who lives in America has a part of his soul in this ark"to the teenage narrator of "Strike and Fade"a powerfully sketched glimpse of inner-city turmoil, who proclaims, "I'm hurtin too much. I'm lettin my heat go down into my soul. When it comes up again, I won't be limpin"Dumas never fails to capture the spirit and collective consciousness of his beloved people. Portions of this book were previously published in Ark of Bones, Rope of Wind and Jonoah and the Green Stone. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.$9.95. f Dumas, a novelist and short story writer, was "accidentally" shot and killed by a policeman in 1968. This collection, bringing together previously published and unpublished pieces, represents the variety, quality, and texture of his prose. Dumas richly depicts the lives of rural and urban black Americans , giving equal consideration and depth to the complexity of Sixties political activism and the truths of folk knowledge. His attention to language is a sustained exploration of how different forms of English can convey diverse versions of lived experience and knowledge, unsettling conventional categories of value.

It has become frequent, two or three times a week, at random times: midnight-three a.m.-five in the morning. Here is a high, empty wail that severs Gene from his unconsciousness like sharp teeth. It is the worst sound that Gene can imagine, the sound of a young child dying violently-falling from a building, or caught in some machinery that is tearing an arm off, or being mauled by a predatory animal. No matter how many times he hears it he jolts up with such images playing in his mind, and he always runs, thumping into the child's bedroom to find Frankie sitting up in bed, his eyes closed, his mouth open in an oval like a Christmas caroler. If someone took a picture of him, he would appear to be in a kind of peaceful trance, as if he were waiting to receive a spoonful of ice cream, rather than emitting that horrific sound.<br><br>"Frankie!" Gene will shout, and claps his hands hard in the child's face. The clapping works well. At this, the scream always stops abruptly, and Frankie opens his eyes, blinking at Gene with vague awareness before settling back down into his pillow, nuzzling a little before growing still. He is sound asleep, he is always sound asleep, though even after months Gene can't help leaning down and pressing his ear to the child's chest, to make sure he's still breathing, his heart is still going. It always is.<br><br>There is no explanation that they can find. In the morning, Frankie doesn't remember anything, and on the few occasions that they have managed to wake him in the midst of one of his screaming attacks, he is merely sleepy and irritable. Once, Gene's wife, Karen, shook him and shook him, until finally he opened his eyes groggily. "Honey?" she said. "Honey? Did you have a bad dream?" But Frankie only moaned a little. "No," he said, puzzled and unhappy at being awakened, but nothing more.<br><br>They can find no pattern to it. It can happen any day of the week, any time of the night. It doesn't seem to be associated with diet, or with his activities during the day, and it doesn't stem, as far as they can tell, from any sort of psychological unease. During the day, he seems perfectly normal and happy.<br><br>They have taken him several times to the pediatrician, but the doctor seems to have little of use to say. There is nothing wrong with the child physically, Dr. Banerjee says. She advises that such things were not uncommon for children of Frankie's age group-he is five-and that more often than not, the disturbance simply passes away.<br><br>"He hasn't experienced any kind of emotional trauma, has he?" the doctor says. "Nothing out of the ordinary at home?"<br><br>"No, no," they both murmur, together. They shake their heads, and Dr. Banerjee shrugs. "Parents," she says. "It's probably nothing to worry about." She gives them a brief smile. "As difficult as it is, I'd say that you may just have to weather this out."<br><br>But the doctor has never heard those screams. In the mornings after the "nightmares," as Karen calls them, Gene feels unnerved, edgy. He works as a driver for the United Parcel Service, and as he moves through the day after a screaming attack, there is a barely perceptible hum at the edge of his hearing, an intent, deliberate static sliding along behind him as he wanders through streets and streets in his van. He stops along the side of the road and listens. The shadows of summer leaves tremble murmurously against the windshield, and cars are accelerating on a nearby road. In the treetops, a cicada makes its trembly, pressure-cooker hiss.<br><br>Something bad has been looking for him for a long time, he thinks, and now, at last, it is growing near.<br><br>When he comes home at night everything is normal. They live in an old house in the suburbs of Cleveland, and sometimes after dinner they work together in the small patch of garden out in back of the house- tomatoes, zucchini, string beans, cucumbers-while Frankie plays with Legos in the dirt. Or they take walks around the neighborhood, Frankie riding his bike in front of them, his training wheels squeaking. They gather on the couch and watch cartoons together, or play board games, or draw pictures with crayons. After Frankie is asleep, Karen will sit at the kitchen table and study-she is in nursing school-and Gene will sit outside on the porch, flipping through a newsmagazine or a novel, smoking the cigarettes that he has promised Karen he will give up when he turns thirty-five. He is thirty-four now, and Karen is twenty- seven, and he is aware, more and more frequently, that this is not the life that he deserves. He has been incredibly lucky, he thinks. Blessed, as Gene's favorite cashier at the supermarket always says. "Have a blessed day," she says, when Gene pays the money and she hands him his receipt, and he feels as if she has sprinkled him with her ordinary, gentle beatitude. It reminds him of long ago, when an old nurse had held his hand in the hospital and said that she was praying for him.<br><br>Sitting out in his lawn chair, drawing smoke out of his cigarette, he thinks about that nurse, even though he doesn't want to. He thinks of the way she'd leaned over him and brushed his hair as he stared at her, imprisoned in a full body cast, sweating his way through withdrawal and DTs.<br><br>He had been a different person, back then. A drunk, a monster. At eighteen, he married the girl he'd gotten pregnant, and then had set about slowly, steadily, ruining all their lives. When he'd abandoned them, his wife and son, back in Nebraska, he had been twenty-four, a danger to himself and others. He'd done them a favor by leaving, he thought, though he still feels guilty when he looks back on it. Years later, when he was sober, he even tried to contact them. He wanted to own up to his behavior, to pay the back child support, to apologize. But they were nowhere to be found. Mandy was no longer living in the small Nebraska town where they'd met and married, and there was no forwarding address. Her parents were dead. No one seemed to know where she'd gone.<br><br>Karen didn't know the full story. She had been, to his relief, uncurious about his previous life, though she knew he had some drinking days, some bad times. She knew that he'd been married before, too, though she didn't know the extent of it, didn't know that he had another son, for example, didn't know that he had left them one night, without even packing a bag, just driving off in the car, a flask tucked between his legs, driving east as far as he could go. She didn't know about the car crash, the wreck he should have died in. She didn't know what a bad person he'd been.<br><br>She was a nice lady, Karen. Maybe a little sheltered. And truth to tell, he was ashamed-and even scared-to imagine how she would react to the truth about his past. He didn't know if she would have ever really trusted him if she'd known the full story, and the longer they have known each other the less inclined he has been to reveal it. He'd escaped his old self, he thought, and when Karen got pregnant, shortly before they were married, he told himself that now he had a chance to do things over, to do it better. They had bought the house together, he and Karen, and now Frankie will be in kindergarten in the fall. He has come full circle, has come exactly to the point when his former life with Mandy and his son, DJ, completely fell apart. He looks up as Karen comes to the back door and speaks to him through the screen. "I think it's time for bed, sweetheart," she says, and he shudders off these thoughts, these memories. He smiles.<br><br>He's been in a strange frame of mind lately. The months of regular awakenings have been getting to him, and he has a hard time going back to sleep after an episode with Frankie. When Karen wakes him in the morning, he often feels muffled, sluggish-as if he's hungover. He doesn't hear the alarm clock. When he stumbles out of bed, he finds he has a hard time keeping his moodiness in check. He can feel his temper coiling up inside him.<br><br>He isn't that type of person anymore, and hasn't been for a long while. Still, he can't help but worry. They say that there is a second stretch of craving, which sets in after several years of smooth sailing; five or seven years will pass, and then it will come back without warning. He has been thinking of going to AA meetings again, though he hasn't in some time-not since he met Karen.<br><br>It's not as if he gets trembly every time he passes a liquor store, or even as if he has a problem when he goes out with buddies and spends the evening drinking soda and nonalchoholic beer. No. The trouble comes at night, when he's asleep.<br><br>He has begun to dream of his first son. DJ. Perhaps it is related to his worries about Frankie, but for several nights in a row the image of DJ-age about five-has appeared to him. In the dream, Gene is drunk, and playing hide-and-seek with DJ in the yard behind the Cleveland house where he is now living. There is the thick weeping willow out there, and Gene watches the child appear from behind it and run across the grass, happy, unafraid, the way Frankie would. DJ turns to look over his shoulder and laughs, and Gene stumbles after him, at least a six-pack's worth of good mood, a goofy, drunken dad. It's so real that when he wakes, he still feels intoxicated. It takes him a few minutes to shake it.<br><br>One morning after a particularly vivid version of this dream, Frankie wakes and complains of a funny feeling-"right here"-he says, and points to his forehead. It isn't a headache, he says. "It's like bees!" he says. "Buzzing bees!" He rubs his hand against his brow. "Inside my head." He considers for a moment. "You know how the bees bump against the window when they get in the house and want to get out?" This description pleases him, and he taps his forehead lightly with his fingers, humming, "Zzzzzzz," to demonstrate.<br><br>"Does it hurt?" Karen says.<br><br>"No," Frankie says. "It tickles."<br><br>Karen gives Gene a concerned look. She makes Frankie lie down on the couch, and tells him to close his eyes for a while. After a few minutes, he raises up, smiling, and...</p><h2>PERIL AT END HOUSE POIROT FACS</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p><p>On holiday on the Cornish Riviera, Hercule Poirot is alarmed to hear pretty Nick Buckley describe her recent &#x201c;accidental brushes with death.&#x201d; First, on a treacherous Cornish hillside, the brakes on her car failed. Then, on a coastal path, a falling boulder missed her by inches.

Her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, written towards the end of World War I, introduced us to Hercule Poirot, who was to become the most popular detective in crime fiction since Sherlock Holmes. She is known throughout the world as the Queen of Crime. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language and another billion in over 100 foreign languages.

A white man, the beloved nephew of the county sheriff, is shot dead on the porch of a black woman. Days later, the sheriff sanctions the lynching of a black woman and three black men, all of them innocent. For Karen Branan, the great-granddaughter of that sheriff, this isn&#x2019;t just history, this is family history. <br> <br>Branan spent nearly twenty years combing through diaries and letters, hunting for clues in libraries and archives throughout the United States, and interviewing community elders to piece together the events and motives that led a group of people to murder four of their fellow citizens in such a brutal public display. Her research revealed surprising new insights into the day-to-day reality of race relations in the Jim Crow&#x2013;era South, but what she ultimately discovered was far more personal. As she dug into the past, Branan was forced to confront her own deep-rooted beliefs surrounding race and family, a process that came to a head when Branan learned a shocking truth: she is related not only to the sheriff, but also to one of the four who were murdered. Both identities&#x2014;perpetrator and victim&#x2014;are her inheritance to bear. <br> <br>A gripping story of privilege and power, anger, and atonement, <i>The Family Tree transports</i> readers to a small Southern town steeped in racial tension and bound by powerful family ties. Branan takes us back in time to the Civil War, demonstrating how plantation politics and the Lost Cause movement set the stage for the fiery racial dynamics of the twentieth century, delving into the prevalence of mob rule, the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and the role of miscegenation in an unceasing cycle of bigotry. <br> <br>Through all of this, what emerges is a searing examination of the violence that occurred on that awful day in 1912&#x2014;the echoes of which still resound today&#x2014;and the knowledge that it is only through facing our ugliest truths that we can move forward to a place of understanding.</p><p>Karen Branan is a veteran journalist who has written for newspapers, magazines, the stage, and television for almost fifty years. Her work has appeared in <i>Life</i>, <i>Mother Jones</i>, &nbsp;<i>Ms</i>., <i>Ladies&#x2019; Home Journal</i>, <i>Good Housekeeping</i>, <i>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i>, and on various television networks.

She grew up in Columbus, Georgia and now lives in Washington, DC.The Family Tree PROLOGUE<p></p> <br>In 1984, G&#x2019;mamma was ninety and I was a middle-aged journalist sitting on the edge of her magnificent antique sleigh bed, atop her hand-crocheted ecru coverlet littered with orange peels, gazing at those perfectly manicured, fire-engine-red nails I&#x2019;d known since childhood. We were in her house in Hamilton, Georgia, the house I had known since childhood. The ever-present Salem cigarette teetered precariously between her long white fingers. She&#x2019;d smoked three packs a day for as long as I could remember. Now she was little more than bones and wrinkles and a cloud-wisp of hair, but the life-force was as fierce as ever.<br> <br>I had come to hear her stories and preserve them for my children and future generations. Placing my tape recorder gently beside her, I, someone who had unflinchingly interviewed murderers, corrupt officials, and gang leaders, eased timidly into an oral history with this frail woman. Any fears of intimidating her with equipment and interrogations vanished as she slipped into Tallulah Bankhead mode, spinning stories of girlhood crushes on male schoolteachers, her love of handwork, her pride in her antiques and other &#x201c;pretty things.&#x201d; There were few needlecrafts she had not mastered.<br> <br>Above the mantelpiece, next to her bed, hung a large tinted photograph, Miss Berta as a Young Belle, brown eyes flirtatious beneath an elegant straw bonnet proudly perched atop careful curls. The hat was a gift from Mr. Bob, her father. She was his only child, an adored, spoiled, quick-tempered, high-strung girl.<br> <br>G&#x2019;mamma had clearly relished our conversation, but I could see that both she and the tape were running out, so I decided to end with a simple question. &#x201c;And what is your most unforgettable memory?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;The hanging,&#x201d; she replied without pause, a faint, nervous smile playing at her thin lips. &#x201c;They hanged a woman and some men right downtown in Hamilton when I was young. I was told to stay home, but everyone else was going, so I sneaked out.&#x201d;<br> <br>As I look back on that moment, in which I was exposed to the first whiff of knowledge about a huge and terrible event, I realize that a combination of ignorance, inexperience, a lack of readiness, and a certain training in southern behavior made me hold my tongue.<br> <br>In the adjoining parlor, my mother eavesdropped. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t believe some things she says,&#x201d; she warned me as I left. &#x201c;She embroiders, you know.&#x201d; I could not know then that eleven years later I&#x2019;d embark on a full-scale excavation of this piece of family history, and that my mother, who learned early to revere her sheriff patriarchs, would continue the embroidery of memory.<br> <br>My experience with memory embroidery began early, though I would not see it that way until I began my research for this book. When I was eleven and my sister ten, we learned that my father was keeping a huge secret from us. Although he was still a well-loved and successful physician at the time, he was drunk, as he often was back then, when he told us this story. As usual we&#x2019;d been begging him to stop drinking, and so he told us this story as a way of explaining why he drank and could not stop. When he was a very young man living in Hamilton, he had accidentally killed a young black woman. She &#x201c;sassed&#x201d; him, he explained; she had refused to step aside to let him pass.<br> <br>&#x201c;I backhanded her and her head hit one of those iron poles outside Cook&#x2019;s Store. I didn&#x2019;t mean to kill her.&#x201d; His patent-leather hair glistened in the late-afternoon gloom of our living room. I thought he looked like Clark Gable. &#x201c;Nothing was ever done,&#x201d; he continued in a voice softened by alcohol. &#x201c;They just took her home, told some lie, and nothing was ever said about it again.&#x201d; Then he added, &#x201c;If you ever want to punish someone for a crime, do nothing. They&#x2019;ll do a much better job on themselves than you could ever do.&#x201d; I took that knowledge, made more potent by the warm bourbon of his breath, and tucked it away on a shelf reserved for things that scared me. In that way, I never really forgot them; I simply deflated their power, turned them into &#x201c;stories.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>In 1993, on a rainy night in April, that story G&#x2019;mamma told came looking for me in another bedroom, my own on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. Outside, a gentle April rain fell; my husband was away in South Africa, filming a documentary. This time the story came in the form of a hypnogogic vision, a scene appearing in the mind&#x2019;s eye at the threshold of sleep. I saw a large, dead black woman laid out at the end of my bed, a burn across one of her temples. She spoke without words, but the message was clear: Go home. Find out what happened. I had always sensed that a day would come when my career as a reporter and my complicated family history would collide in some crucial way, and I was certain this was that long-expected assignment. I accepted it without question.<br> <br>I was not alone in my new preoccupation. The nation, indeed the world, was being drawn to acknowledge past wrongs. While racial violence flared with the ruthless beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police, followed by race riots and the burning of African American churches throughout the South by white skinheads, old racial crimes were being revived and some actually prosecuted.<br> <br>At the time that I experienced this vision at my home on Capitol Hill, I&#x2019;d been thinking and writing about the young woman whom my father, now dead, told me long ago he&#x2019;d accidentally killed; I&#x2019;d been doing so as a way to ease her into my consciousness. I thought that she might be the one I saw in my vision, and thus went home to learn more about what happened between this nameless young black woman and the surly teenager who would become my father.<br> <br>I returned to Hamilton, a small town no longer peopled with my grandparents, aunts, and uncles, but still home to cousins and elderly men and women, black and white, with strong memories and ties to my kinfolk. It was no longer a thriving village of cotton gins and overflowing mercantiles; a train depot; large, ambitious white families; and longtime black servants. Now it was a town of antique shops and thrift stores, a tanning parlor, a drugstore, and several low-end restaurants. Still standing were the Confederate statue and the antebellum houses of Mobleys, Williamses, Hudsons, and Bealls, one inhabited by Little Sister Hudson Garrett, the last descendant of one of the ruling families, and still living on the square.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your father never killed that woman,&#x201d; my aunt Evelyn told me. She would know. Only twelve years old at the time, she was with him when whatever happened took place. Indeed, he&#x2019;d told me it was Evelyn whose &#x201c;honor&#x201d; he was defending by smacking a black girl who refused to step off their path. &#x201c;He backhanded her, sure. That sassy little Pearly Lee. But she didn&#x2019;t even fall down, much less die. Where&#x2019;d he get that crazy idea? Why, Pearly Lee died just recently.&#x201d; I checked; she was right. Others, black and white, men and women, confirmed her version. &#x201c;Ben Williams never killed a soul,&#x201d; they&#x2019;d say, shaking their heads in wonder that he could hold such a misconception for so long, could drink on it, drug on it, die and carry it to his grave never realizing it wasn&#x2019;t true.<br> <br>Nevertheless, as I asked my questions, other stories of violence, racial and otherwise, emerged. &#x201c;Surely you know about Tip Top?&#x201d; someone would ask, then proceed to tell me about my great-uncle Dock Williams, a rough-and-tumble, red-faced old son of a gun, who murdered and was murdered atop Pine Mountain in 1920, and about Louis &#x201c;Sugar Bear&#x201d; Murray, a black man who was hanged in the jailhouse for the crimes of the rich men&#x2019;s sons who were really responsible. In addition to the Tip Top murders, I was treated to more tales of white-on-white murders&#x2014;the Mobley brothers who killed the Truett man, the Truett man who killed the Robinson man, and on it went. In the courthouse I found a &#x201c;Parties Unknown&#x201d; box of coroners&#x2019; reports detailing more grisly murders, bodies of black men and women dumped in the river, weighted with rocks. On that one visit, I heard so many violent tales that, as I drove home, I envisioned the waters of the serpentine Mulberry Creek and the once-magnificent Chattahoochee River red with blood, not clay, their beds pebbled with teeth and bones.<br> <br>Back in Evelyn&#x2019;s tiny dining room, I asked her about &#x201c;the hanging&#x201d; of G&#x2019;mamma&#x2019;s memory. &#x201c;Oh, that,&#x201d; she half-scoffed. &#x201c;That was a bunch of men fightin&#x2019; over some colored woman.&#x201d; She took a drag off her cigarette, curled her lip, and added, rolling her eyes, &#x201c;They did that back then, you know.&#x201d;<br> <br>The next day, at my sister&#x2019;s house in Atlanta, I picked up a book she&#x2019;d just received for her birthday. There, in a sentence, I found all I needed: &#x201c;Three men and a woman were lynched in Hamilton, Georgia, on January 22, 1912.&#x201d; Back home on Capitol Hill, adrenaline rushing, I sprinted the seven blocks from home to the Periodical Reading Room at the Library of Congress. At best I&#x2019;d thought I&#x2019;d find a paragraph or two buried deeply within a newspaper. Wrongly, I&#x2019;d assumed southern newspaper editors were not proud of mob justice and often let such events escape notice.<br> <br>I had not expected bold headlines, a major front-page story in the Atlanta Constitution: FOUR NEGROES LYNCHED BY HAMILTON AVENGERS; WOMAN ONE OF VICTIMS. Avengers, my brain tabulated: Avenging what?<br> <br>And then I saw it coming like headlights gleaming out of the fog, the third boldfaced headline: Negroes were accused of murdering Hadley. Hadley. My mother&#x2019;s maiden name. Which Hadley? Murdered? This I&#x2019;d never heard. The next headline and some further probing provided the answer: Hadley, Who Was a Well-to-do Planter Was Shot Sunday Afternoon While Sitting in His Home&#x2014;Negroes Held on Suspicion&#x2014;About Hundred Men in Mob. By now I had stopped breathing, but not reading. Suddenly the microfilm machine lost focus and, while I fiddled frantically, an intercom announced that the library was closing and lights began to blink. I would have to wait until tomorrow.<br> <br>I turned the machine off and for a moment sat drawn into myself, barely breathing, eyes closed, scalp drawing tight the way it does just before a virus settles in. Well, here it was, the thing I sought. &#x201c;Be careful when you go shaking those family trees,&#x201d; Evelyn had warned. &#x201c;You never know what you&#x2019;ll find.&#x201d; She was sure as hell right about that.<br> <br>Norman Hadley, the murder victim, was my cousin. My great-grandfather, Marion Madison Hadley, the newly elected sheriff, was his uncle. A sickening shock coursed through me. A cousin I&#x2019;d never heard of had been shot through the head and killed. It never occurred to me that a kinsman had ever been murdered. Both sides of my family&#x2014;sheriffs, deputies, a judge, legislators, a senator&#x2014;seemed so well defended, especially against black people.<br> <br>A woman and three men, one of them a preacher, two of them farmers, all of them black, had been hanged by a mob of men, many surely related to Norman Hadley. Beside the baptismal pool, outside the Friendship Baptist Church, a short walk from where the sheriff lived. Hanged and shot more than three hundred times on a wintry January night. And as I sat there growing numb, I intuitively knew that many more of my kinfolk had been caught up in that madness, on one side or the other.<br> <br>I desperately hoped the sheriff had tried to stop it. In that moment I experienced an odd sense that I had known all these people, the murderers, the silent ones, the murdered ones, the powerless ones. I felt myself there with each man, woman, and child snared in that net and I hungered for every detail of their lives. Who were they? How did they live, think, vote, love, laugh, write, speak, work, live, raise children, treat their neighbors? What did they know of one another, the murderers and the murdered? What long road had they traveled together? I was not willing to accept that this was simply the way white southerners dealt with &#x201c;racial matters.&#x201d; This was, to my knowledge, the only public lynching ever carried out in Harris County. There was something I and perhaps others could learn from this tragic affair. Perhaps we could understand what turns mild-mannered, churchgoing family men into cold-blooded killers, how something so shameful happens in the heart of a simple village and virtually disappears and where, if anywhere, it goes; whether it ripples down through generations, finding new forms in the future; and where, indeed, I might find its residue in my own life. I determined to learn all I could.</p><h2>A Fine Dark Line</h2><p>Young Stanley Mitchell, Jr., enters the underworld of his 1958 East Texas home when he discovers a cache of love letters by a murdered girl, comes to understand how love affects the lives of those closest to him, and experiences his first encounters with blues music, racism, and lost dreams. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>Joe. R. Lansdale has won the British Fantasy Award, the American Horror Award, and six Bram Stoker Awards. He lives in Nacogdoches, Texas.If Mark Twain had written To Kill a Mockingbird or Summer of '42, it might sound something like Dick Hill's reading of A Fine Dark Line. Hill has the ear, the pitch, and the understanding to tell the story of 13-year-old Stanley Mitchell's all too fast coming-of-age in precisely the way author Joe Lansdale intended. In fact, Hill is the perfect match for Lansdale, who is no slouch when it comes to the oral storytelling tradition. Living in Dewmont, Texas, in 1958, where his parents own a drive-in theater, Stanley is completely ignorant of issues of sex, race, poverty, and violence. When he discovers a box of old love letters and journal entries near the ruins of a long-ago house fire, he unwittingly uncovers a forgotten scandal and several murders. S.E.S.

Conrad's Congo is hell itself, a place where civilization won't take, where literal and metaphor darknesses converge, and where human conduct, unmoored from social (Western, in other words) norms, turns barbaric. As Robert Edgerton shows in this crisply narrated yet sweeping work of history, the Congo is still trying to awaken from the nightmare of its past, struggling to pull free from the grip of the "heart of darkness" cliche. <br><br>Plundered for centuries for its natural resources (which remain Africa's most abundant), the Congo was not always a place of horror. Before the Portuguese landed on its shores at the end of the 15th century, it was a prosperous and thriving region. The Congo River, the world's second longest as well as the deepest, and one of the only routes to the continent's interior, provided indigenous populations with ample means for living and trading. What the Portuguese found first to exploit were people, and with the slave trade began a dizzying downward spiral of conquest and degradation that continued for centuries. By the 19th century the race to explore the full length of the legendary river masked a fight for territorial and moral control among the French, Arabs, British, Germans, as well as American missionaries, all of whom dreamed of possessing Africa's very heart. When King Leopold of Belgium managed to solidify control in 1885, the Congo "question" seemed solved. His reign, of course, was almost pathological in its cruelty-the true source of Conrad's "horror"-and its grim legacy endures to this day.<br><br>Edgerton documents the Congo's long, sad history with a sense of empathy with and admiration for the character of the land and its inhabitants. Since independence in June 1960, the country has endured the machinations and disappointments of one dictator after another, beginning with Patrice Lumumba, and continuing through Joseph Mobutu, Laurent Kabila, and today Kabila's son, Joseph, who assumed power after his father was assassinated in January 2001. Whether called the "Congo Free State," or "Zaire," or the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the country remains perilously unstable.<br><br><i>s20The Troubled Heart of Africa</i> is the only book to give a complete history of the Congo, filling in the blanks in the country's history before the advent of Henry Stanley, David Livingstone, King Leopold, and other figures, and carrying us straight into today's headlines. The Congo continues today to be the subject of intense speculation and concern, and with good reason: upon it hangs the fate of sub-Sahara Africa as a whole. Here is a book that helps us face the stark truths of the Congo's past and appreciate both the enormous potential and uncertainty of its future.<br></p><p>Robert B.

When Europeans first discovered it in the late fifteenth century, it was home to at least 250 different ethnic groups, ranging over fifteen cultural regions as different as the Mbuti Pygmies, who lived by hunting in the Ituri Forest in the eastern Congo, and the prosperous farmers of the Bakongo Kingdom in the west, where cleared fields and large towns once supported well over a million people spread across three hundred square miles.1 Most of the peoples in the Congo spoke a Bantu language, and although most of these were not mutually intelligible, the first word an infant uttered in all of them was &#x201c;Mama&#x201d;&#x2014;mother&#x2014;and a dying person&#x2019;s last utterance, too, was often &#x201c;Mama.&#x201d;2 There were also people in the northeast of the Congo who spoke Sudanic or Nigritic languages, including the warlike Azande people, who successfully resisted European rule well into the twentieth century.Large portions of the Congo are open, strikingly beautiful, silver-baobab-tree-dotted savannas of tall, yellow elephant grass that are home to herds of wildlife. Some hilly areas are covered with ten- to twelve-foot-tall grass with edges so sharp that when dry, cut like razors. Other regions, particularly in the east, are steeply mountainous but split by deep valleys where bamboo, tree ferns, huge orchids, lobelias, and other beautiful flowers flourish. The volcanic peaks and glaciers in this eastern region, known as the Mountains of the Moon, are permanently snowcapped and higher than the Alps. Their foothills are black lava, and nearby lakes are jade green or a brilliant blue. These eastern uplands are so cold that they are completely free of both flies and mosquitoes, and the Europeans who later came to live there had to wear sweaters even at midday. But the low-lying regions of the Congo are intensely hot, steamingly humid, and home to multitudes of fleas, centipedes, large grasshoppers with green bodies and scarlet wings, cicadas, cockroaches, bees, ticks, leeches, hornets with a painful sting, little green fireflies, and myriads of beautiful butterflies and dragonflies of all colors. Throughout the low-lying, central Congo basin, there are hordes of flies as large as hornets, and blood-sucking mites, while every evening brings swarms of mosquitoes so voracious they can bite through European clothing.3Large portions of the Congo are permanent swampland, but almost half of the country is covered by a dense, dark tropical forest&#x2014;&#x201c;darkness,&#x201d; literally. Within these forests there are lichenand moss-covered ebony, oak, mahogany, cedar, walnut, and rubber trees, as well as clumps of bamboo all tied together by lianas and flowering vines. Within many of these dark forests there is rarely any sound or movement, and a sickening smell of decaying vegetation pervades the air. Usually, no birds, bats, or monkeys are to be seen, nor whirring insects to be heard. The silence is so profound that when explorers in large caravans first entered these forests, they felt compelled to speak in whispers, and if a monkey chattered, a toucan shrieked, or a tree limb fell, they were visibly startled.In most of these forests, there are no flowers, but a dark green wall of trees usually rising two hundred feet overhead. The ground is covered with sodden, decaying vegetation that often is several feet deep. European explorers often despaired of cutting their way through these &#x201c;jungles,&#x201d; as they called them, a Hindi word meaning impenetrable thicket. Yet, in some parts of the Congo, forests such as these have long been cleared, allowing millions of people to farm the now open land. In many of these areas, palm trees flourished, providing both highly valued palm oil and palm wine in return for little effort. Bananas and yams also thrived in these hot, moist regions while older crops such as sorghum and millet would not. And in some parts of these forests there are bats, rats, flying squirrels, civet cats, hairy pigs, monitor lizards six feet long, and even elephants.Much of the Congo basin is crisscrossed by so many wide, rapidly flowing, mud-brown rivers that together they make up one-sixth of the world&#x2019;s hydroelectric potential. Spanned by hundreds of vine bridges, dotted by over four thousand islands covered with trees, reeds, mangroves, and water hyacinth, most of these rivers have long been traveled by people paddling standing up in long canoes made from hollowed-out tree trunks. The rivers are home to many crabs, shrimp, turtles, hippopotamuses, and crocodiles, while nearby live thousands of pelicans, egrets, ducks, pygmy geese even smaller than ducks, kingfishers with scarlet beaks, five-foot-tall purple herons, sacred ibises, white-tailed flycatchers, scarlet and black weaver birds, and fish-eating eagles. Many people came to live along the banks of these rivers, fishing and farming after they had cleared away the forests atop sandstone cliffs that were sometimes red, sometimes yellow, and even white. But most people did not live along riverbanks; they built their villages in fertile valleys farther inland and walked some distance to pick up water for drinking and bathing. The Congo River itself was not only a rich resource for fish and crustaceans, but it also posed few dangers because it neither flooded nor ran dry. Because the Congo&#x2019;s tributaries come from both north of the equator and south of it, when it is the rainy season in one region, it is dry in the other, maintaining the huge river&#x2019;s even flow year-round.The Congo&#x2019;s more open forests and grasslands are still home to elephants, giraffes, zebras, buffaloes, lions, leopards, cheetahs, and all manner of antelope, ostriches, and smaller animals, such as rabbit-sized nocturnal tree-hyraxes that emit ear-piercing screams, while carrion-eating hyenas, jackals, and vultures are still seemingly everywhere.4 But rhinos have never lived there. In some forested areas there are still seemingly millions of monkeys, while in others there are none. In parts of the eastern Congo there are both chimpanzees and gorillas. Pythons, cobras, mambas, puff adders, and other deadly snakes are commonplace as well, as are scorpions, huge, beautiful spiders, and fiercely biting, inch-long red ants. At times, so many black bats can fly overhead that the sky is literally obliterated. People still use machetes or even sticks to knock them out of the air and cook them. Even away from the rivers, hundreds of different sorts of birds live in the Congo, from majestic eagles and hawks to gray parrots with bright scarlet tails, long-winged blue swallows, red-chested cuckoos, thick, gray plovers, and black hornbills.Despite its location astride the equator, the Congo has dramatically differing seasons. For much of the region, from February to May there is heavy rain and flooding. But, even during the rainy season, it does not rain every day. Some days are dry but the sky is gray and the sun is seldom seen. When rain does fall, it is sometimes so warm that some travelers have likened it to human sweat.5 However, every two or three days during the late afternoon, a huge purple-black cloud forms in the east. As it moves to the west, the air becomes still and claps of distant thunder grow louder by the minute. As the black, arching cloud finally passes overhead, lightning strikes, thunder crashes, and the wind suddenly roars at sixty or seventy miles an hour, driving torrents of rain almost horizontally, flooding everything for an hour or so before moving on, leaving behind a gentle rain that may continue throughout the night. In Katanga, the Congo&#x2019;s southernmost province, when thunderstorms strike at its four-thousand-foot elevation, spray splashes five or six feet into the air, making it impossible to drive a car.From May through October the weather is usually dry but cloudy, and it is cold at night with temperatures often falling to fifty degrees Fahrenheit even at lower elevations, and sometimes reaching freezing in Katanga. It can also be so cold during the day that hail the size of hen&#x2019;s eggs has been known to fall for hours and people have to stay inside by a warm fire. October, November, and December are rainy and hot, while January is dry and still hot. Whether humid or dry, although mornings are usually damp and cold, in many areas the midday heat is oppressive.Whatever the season, diseases continue to be rampant. There are waterborne afflictions such as schistosomiasis, Guinea threadworm, and &#x201c;river blindness,&#x201d; as well as bouts of malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery, and yellow fever. Mosquito-borne yellow fever strikes abruptly with a high fever, headache, muscle pain, and violent vomiting. Blood pressure falls, blood oozes from every tissue surface, and the kidneys fail. As recently as 1960-62, yellow fever killed thirty thousand people in Ethiopia. The Congo has also been plagued by tuberculosis, pneumonia, smallpox, influenza, and with the arrival of Europeans and Arabs, syphilis. Until European rule took hold early in the twentieth century, there were wars, too, and both cannibalism and slavery were common although not universal. Nevertheless, the Congo&#x2019;s population was large, perhaps as much as 20 million people, and growing at the time of European contact at the end of the fifteenth century.The ancestors of these people began to migrate south and west into the Congo basin perhaps five thousand years ago. The first to arrive were light-skinned Pygmies, who lived by hunting and gathering in the Congo&#x2019;s game-rich forests. They were not warlike, but despite their diminutive size they were well able to defend themselves if attacked. Capable of hiding almost to the point of invisibility in their dense forests, they could throw a spear hard enough to pass halfway through a man and could fire their deadly poisoned arrows so rapidly that four could be in the air before the first one struck. Although these little people-even today men average less than four feet six inches in height while the women are smaller still&#x2014;did not practice any form of horticulture, they knew how to make fire, were skilled metallurgists, had effective medical practitioners, and created a joyous way of life that continues to this day among Pygmy groups.Sometime around two thousand years ago, much taller, usually but not always darker-skinned Bantu-speaking horticulturalists began to move into the basin, fully settling it by A.D. 1,000. They borrowed much from the Pygmies, who traded dried meat and honey for agricultural products, salt, and iron.6 Bantu people treated the Pygmies as markedly inferior&#x2014;&#x201c;mere animals&#x201d; they often called them&#x2014;and in return the Pygmies had little respect for the Bantu people. Yet, in their growing interdependence with farmers, the Pygmies somehow lost their languages. Nevertheless, they were highly successful hunters and gatherers. Pygmy groups routinely gathered nine or ten types of fruit, as many as eight types of snails, thirteen kinds of termites, and over twenty kinds of caterpillars, as well as several kinds of honey and over thirty types of mushrooms. Their nutrition was every bit as good as that of the Bantu farmers, and sometimes better.7Like the Pygmies, Bantu-speaking farmers sometimes hunted, trapped, and gathered, but they relied mainly on cultivation. Initially dependent on yams, they later adopted imported American plants such as maize, manioc, beans, and tobacco and also came to rely on avocados, sugarcane, pineapples, coconuts, tangerines, peanuts, and especially bananas, which were relatively easy to grow as they required little clearing of forests yet provided a yield ten times that of yams.8 One large Bantu society, the Bakongo Kingdom, cultivated twelve species of vegetables, a different one becoming ripe each month of the year.9 These farming people became highly skilled ironworkers, potters, weavers, and artists. The social systems they created were complex yet effective. There was little crime and steady population growth. There were many differences among the hundreds of societies in the Congo. Some had marked social inequality, while others were largely egalitarian; some had complex ceremonials, while others did not; some were fiercely warlike but others avoided conflict whenever possible; and some lived in simple bamboo houses, while others fashioned large wooden homes that were elegantly decorated. Despite warfare and the ravages of tropical disease, their populations grew, their religious beliefs and institutions prospered, and most people&#x2019;s lives appear to have been rewarding.In the fifth century B.C., Herodotus told of an expedition that sailed south of the Canary Islands, and in the first century A.D., Pliny described an admiral who sailed all the way to Senegal.10 But no European is known to have ventured into the Congo&#x2019;s &#x201c;darkness&#x201d; until 1482, ten years before Columbus sailed to North America. Both dangerous and alluring, Africa south of the Sahara was still thought by Europeans to be the home of one-eyed or two-headed people, among other monsters, as well as ferocious, gigantic animals, including birds large enough to carry away elephants, and ants as big as foxes. It was also thought to be the home of long-lost Prester (Presbyter) John, a Christian king who according to legend possessed a fountain of youth as well as unimaginable wealth from his many gold mines. Thanks to a forged letter from Prester John that reached the pope around A.D. 1165, Europeans became terrified of Africa. The letter not only described his wealth, it warned of Africa&#x2019;s horrible dangers and horrors. Thousands of copies were made and it was widely circulated. Some Europeans hoped to discover Prester John and share in his vast riches. But despite the lure of Prester John&#x2019;s gold and his fountain of youth, Africa&#x2019;s dangers remained terrifying.South of the Canary Islands off the southern coast of Morocco lay what was known to Europeans as the dreaded Sea of Darkness, where every imaginable horror awaited any European explorer rash enough to enter it&#x2014;liquid sheets of flame falling from the sky, a boiling ocean, mountainous waves, and deadly whirlpools where Satan lay in wait to kill. Should anyone miraculously survive these deadly terrors, he would be forever lost in the inescapable and even more fearsome Sea of Obscurity, which lay beyond the Sea of Darkness. Yet urged on by their king, who craved the riches of unknown lands as well as the discovery of a passageway to the great wealth of India, dauntless Portuguese ship captains eventually sailed through the Seas of Darkness and Obscurity in such numbers that by the middle of the fifteenth century, fifty of their ships had reached the coast of Guinea. They returned to Portugal with over a thousand African slaves. Arabs had long taken African slaves from Sudan, but these were the first Africans known to be enslaved by Europeans.11All the while, shipbuilders in Lisbon&#x2014;at the cutting edge of their profession&#x2014;worked to improve their sailing ships, especially the new <i>caravel</i>, a relatively small vessel, only sixty to a hundred feet long, with a broad bow, small stern, three masts bearing cloth and lateen sails, and a crew no larger than fifty or sixty men. By the latter half of the fifteenth century these new ships were able to survive powerful storms and to sail into the wind. As the years passed, Portuguese caravels sailed progressively farther south down Africa&#x2019;s northwest coast and then east along its south-facing western &#x201c;slave&#x201d; and &#x201c;gold&#x201d; coast, as it would later be named by British explorers and slave traders. In 1482, an...</p><h2>Making WAVES: Navy Women of World War II</h2><p>In the spirit of his successful books <i>At Ease</i> and <i>Men of WWII</i>, Evan Bachner now focuses on the women of WWII. While traditionally female secretarial and clerical jobs took an expectedly large portion of recruits, thousands of WAVES (Women Accepted for Voluntary Emergency Service) performed previously atypical duties in the aviation community&#x2014;such as Judge Advocate General corps&#x2014;medical professions, communications, intelligence, science, and technology.<br><br>The photography team, headed by legendary photographer Edward Steichen, captured these heroic women at work, rest, and play. All the photos are from the National Archives and most have not been previously published.</p><p>Evan Bachner is a longtime collector of photographs and an photographic historian. He lives in New York City.<br>As in his previous collections (At Ease and Men of World War II), photographic historian Bachner has raided the National Archives for the work of the Naval Aviation Photographic unit-which included outstanding photographers like Edward Steichen, Harry Bristol, Charles Steinheimer and Dwight Long-whose mission it was to "visually describe the war to the American people." In 150 photos, this group of "New Realists" depict the working lives of the first women to join the U.S. Navy, the WAVES (Women Accepted for Voluntary Emergency Service). Taking readers into the training, transportation, work and down time of these women, it's clear that their efforts-as radio operators, aviation machinists, aircraft repairmen, public information officers, meteorological technicians and others-were taken seriously not just by the women themselves, but by the all-male team that documented them. As such, their photos convey beautifully the "We Can Do It!" spirit of the time, when sacrifice and service were expected of every American. In addition, Bachner's work in the National Archives allows him to include many of the women's names, deepening the connection one immediately feels with these skillful, revealing and charismatic portraits. This collection of little-seen photographs will undoubtedly make a valuable addition to anyone's WWII library. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

While those recipes usually get the spotlight, the technical know-how behind preparing and smoking meats is far more important. When writing about cold or hot smoke the authors don&#39;t end on just giving the temperature range for a particular method. They also explain why one way is better for making certain products than the other.

Later, he lived in South Africa and Argentina where he discovered different ways of food preparation. Now, living in the USA, he passes his knowledge to his sons.1.3 Smoking, barbecuing, and grilling.<br><br> A lot of people don&#x2019;t understand the difference between smoking, barbecuing, and grilling. When grilling, you quickly seal in the juices from the piece you are cooking. Grilling takes minutes. Smoking takes hours, sometimes even days. <br><br> Don&#x2019;t be fooled by the common misconception that by throwing some wet wood chips over hot coals you can smoke your meat. At best you can only add some flavor on the outside because the moment the outside surface of the meat becomes dry and cooked, a significant barrier exists that prevents smoke penetration. <br><br> A properly smoked piece of meat has to be thoroughly smoked, on the outside and everywhere inside. Only prolonged cold smoking will achieve that result. Smoking when grilling is no better than pumping liquid smoke into it and claiming that the product is smoked now.<br><br> Let&#x2019;s unravel some of the mystery. All these methods are different from each other, especially smoking and grilling. The main factor separating them is temperature<br><br>Smoking &#x2013; almost no heat, 52� &#x2013; 140� F, (12� - 60� C), 1 hr to 2 weeks<br><br>Barbecuing &#x2013; low heat, 200� &#x2013; 300� F, (93� - 150� C) few hours<br><br>Grilling &#x2013; high heat, 500� F, (260� C), minutes<br><br> The purpose of grilling is to char the surface of meat and seal in the juices by creating a smoky caramelized crust. By the same token a barrier is erected that prevents smoke from flowing inside. The meat may have a somewhat smoky flavor on the outside but it was never smoked internally. <br><br> Barbecuing comes much closer, but not close enough. It is a long, slow, indirect, low-heat method that uses charcoal or wood pieces to smoke-cook the meat. The best definition is that barbecuing is cooking with smoke. It is ideally suited for large pieces of meat, like whole pigs. The temperature range of 200� &#x2013;300� F is still too high to smoke meats since the fat that binds meat in sausages will melt away through the casings, and the final product will taste like bread crumbs. <br><br> Smoking is what it says: smoking meats with smoke that may or may not be followed by cooking. Some products are only smoked at low temperatures and never cooked, yet are safe to eat. Generally we may say that smoking in most cases consists of two steps:<br><br>Smoking<br>Cooking <br><br> After smoking is done we increase the temperature to about 170�F (76� C) to start cooking. We want to cook meats or sausages to 152 F� (67� C) internal temperature and here the quality and insulation of the smoker plays an important role. Nevertheless the main smoking process is performed below 140� F.<br><br> There are important differences between smoking and barbecuing. Barbecued or grilled meats are eaten immediately the moment they are done. Smoked meats are usually eaten at a later date. When smoking foods a higher degree of smoke penetration is needed and that can only be achieved at lower temperatures. Furthermore, smoked meats are eaten cold. Many great recipes require that smoked products hang for a designated time to lose more weight to become drier. It is only then that they are ready for consumption.</p><h2>Vasa Saga the Story of a Ship</h2><p>Used. Very Good conditions.

Famed psychotherapist Alice Miller says, &#34;I have undergone this therapy myself and felt its astonishing holistic effect on the body, mind, and emotions.&#34;</p><p>Text: English<br> Original Language: GermanStettbacher, a Swiss psychotherapist, undertakes a thoughtful inquiry into the psychological causes of "primal wounds." These psychological traumas, endured during birth or early childhood, result in the repression of painful memories in the unconscious mind and can cause emotional distress and difficulty many years later. Stettbacher contends that healing these deep unconscious memories requires bringing them into conscious awareness. In order to facilitate this process, he suggests a four-step program of primal therapy, which he employs in his psychotherapy practice. Stettbacher provides a thorough but nontechnical explanation of his therapy, and his four steps are simple enough for anyone to learn.

Photographs and time lines also commemorate important dates and events. An Army Air Corps veteran who enlisted in 1941 at age seventeen writes to describe the Bataan Death March. A black nurse tells of her encounter with wartime segregation. Other members of the Greatest Generation describe their war&#x2014;in such historic episodes as Guadalcanal, the D-Day invasion, the Battle of the Bulge, and Midway&#x2014;as well as their lives on the home front. Starting with the Depression and Pearl Harbor, moving on through the war years in Europe, in the Pacific, and at home, this unique book preserves a people&#x2019;s rich historical heritage and the legacy of a nation&#x2019;s heroism in war and its courage in peace&#x2014;in the shaping of their lives and of the world we have today.</p><p>Tom Brokaw has turned his popular book <i>The Greatest Generation</i> into a trilogy. After that first success came <i>The Greatest Generation Speaks</i>. Now there's <i>An Album of Memories</i>, a collection of letters and photos sent to Brokaw by readers who grew up during the Depression and came of age during World War II. <p> <i>An Album of Memories</i> simply overflows with nostalgia. "We were privileged to grow up in a time when honor, truth, loyalty, duty, and patriotism were real and meant something," writes Robert Cromer. Another correspondent, Douglas G. Fish, describes his own wartime experience--and that of many others--with an elegant simplicity: "I went in the service as a boy and came out a man." There are poignant letters from the dead. One reader submitted this one, sent home in 1942: "Dear Mom, I got your package and Dot's letter today. Boy, the cookies were swell, all the boys send their thanks. Not a one of them was crushed either." Almost exactly a year later, the writer was killed on a bombing run. Another man shares "the last letter my father wrote, three days before he died." It reads: "Tomorrow is D-Day at Iwo Jima--right on Japan's front doorstep--we will go in and lay nets sometime during the assault.... I have faith in God to help us through to victory but am prepared to die for America and face our Lord if He so wills it." The son who sent this letter to Brokaw wasn't even born until after his father had been killed: "I read [this letter] every year on Memorial Day, cry a lot, and think of what a hero he was," he writes. </p><p> It's hard not to agree with that assessment, and it applies to so many of those who fought bravely in Europe or the Pacific, as well as those who maintained the home front. All of them have their say in this attractive volume. <i>--John J.

Polarized Oakleys shielded his eyes from the brunt of the sun's rays; still, he squinted through his windshield's glare, desperate to identify the burning aircraft that now spun and hurtled towards earth, a smoldering comet's tail of black smoke left hanging above it.</p><p>It was a helicopter, a large Army Chinook, and horrific though the situation must have been for those on board, the driver of the Land Rover breathed a subdued sigh of relief. His extraction transport was to be a Russian-built KA-32T, crewed by Polish mercenaries and flown in from over the border in Turkey. The driver found the dying Chinook regrettable but preferable to a dying KA-32T.</p><p>He watched the chopper spin in its uncontrolled descent, staining the blue sky directly in front of him with burning fuel.</p><p>He turned the Land Rover hard to the right and accelerated eastward. The blood-soaked driver wanted to get as far away from here as fast as possible. As much as he wished there was something he could do for the Americans on board the Chinook, he knew their fate was out of his hands.</p><p>And he had his own problems. For five hours he'd raced across the flatlands of western Iraq, fleeing the dirty work he'd left behind, and now he was less than twenty minutes from his exfiltration. A shot-down chopper meant that in minutes this place would be crawling with armed fighters, defiling bodies, shooting assault rifles into the air, and jumping around like fucking morons.</p><p>It was a party the bloodstained driver would not mind missing, lest he himself become a party favor.</p><p>The Chinook sank off to his left and disappeared behind a brown ridge in the distance.</p><p>The driver fixed his eyes on the road ahead. <i>Not my problem</i>, he told himself. He was not trained to search and to rescue, he was not trained to give aid, and he&nbsp; certainly was not trained to negotiate for hostages.</p><p>He was trained to kill. He'd done so back over the border in Syria, and now it was time to get out of the kill zone.</p><p>As his Rover accelerated through the haze and dust at over one hundred kilometers an hour, he began a dialogue with himself. His inner voice wanted to turn back, to race to the Chinook's crash site to check for survivors. His outer voice, on the other hand, was more pragmatic.</p><p>"Keep moving, Gentry, just keep moving. Those dudes are fucked. Nothing you can do about it."</p><p>Gentry's spoken words were sensible, but his inner monologue just would not shut up.</p><br><p>ONE</p><br><p>The first gunmen arriving at the crash site were not Al Qaeda and had nothing to do with the shoot down. They were four local boys with old wooden--stocked Kalashnikovs who'd held a sloppy morning roadblock a hundred meters from where the chopper impacted with the city street. The boys pushed through the growing phalanx of onlookers, the shopkeepers and the street kids who dove for cover when the twin-rotor helicopter hurtled down among them, and the taxi drivers who swerved off the road to avoid the American craft. The four young gunmen approached the scene warily but without a shred of tactical skill. A loud snap from the raging fire, a single handgun round cooking off in the heat, sent them all to cover. After a moment's hesitation, their heads popped back up, they aimed their rifles, and then emptied their barking and bucking guns into the twisted metal machine.</p><p>A man in a blackened American military uniform crawled from the wreckage and received two dozen rounds from the boys' weapons. The soldier's struggle ceased as soon as the first bullets raked across his back.</p><p>Braver now after the adrenaline rush of killing a man in front of the crowd of shouting civilians, the boys broke cover and moved closer to the wreckage. They reloaded their rifles and raised them to shoot at the burning bodies of the flight crew in the cockpit. But before they could open fire, three vehicles raced up from behind: pickup trucks full of armed Arabian foreigners.</p><p>Al Qaeda.</p><p>The local kids wisely backed away from the aircraft, stood back with the civilians, and chanted a devotional to God as the masked men fanned out in the road around the wreckage.</p><p>The broken corpses of two more soldiers fell clear from the rear of the Chinook, and these were the first images of the scene caught by the three-man Al Jazeera camera crew that jumped from truck three.</p><br><p>Just under a mile away, Gentry pulled off the road, turned into a dry streambed, and forced the Land Rover as deep as possible into the tall brown river grasses. He climbed out of the truck and raced to the tailgate, swung a pack onto his back, and hefted a long camel-colored case by its carry handle.</p><p>As he moved away from the vehicle, he noticed the drying blood all over his loose-fitting local clothing for the first time. The blood was not his own, but there was no mystery to the stain.</p><p>He knew whose blood it was.</p><p>Thirty seconds later, he crested the little ridge by the streambed and crawled forward as quickly as possible while pushing his gear in front of him. When Gentry felt suitably invisible in the sand and reeds, he pulled a pair of binoculars from the pack and brought them to his eyes, centered on the plume of black smoke rising in the distance.</p><p>His taut jaw muscles flexed.</p><p>The Chinook had come to rest on a street in the town of al Ba'aj, and already a mob had descended on the debris. Gentry's binoculars were not powerful enough to provide much detail, so he rolled onto his side and unsnapped the camel-colored case.</p><p>Inside was a Barrett M107, a fifty-caliber rifle that fired shells half the size of beer bottles and dispatched the heavy bullets with a muzzle velocity of nearly nine football fields a second.</p><p>Gentry did not load the gun, only aimed the rifle at the crash site to use the powerful optics mounted to it. Through the sixteen-power glass he could see the fire, the pickup trucks, the unarmed civilians, and the armed gunmen.</p><p>Some were unmasked. Local thugs.</p><p>Others wore black masks or wrapped keffiyeh to cover their faces. This would be the Al Qaeda contingent. The foreign fucks. Here to kill Americans and collaborators and to take advantage of the instability in the region.</p><p>A glint of metal rose into the air and swung down. A sword hacking at a figure on the ground. Even through the powerful sniper scope Gentry could not tell if the&nbsp; prostrate man had been dead or alive when the blade slashed into him.</p><p>His jaw tightened again. Gentry was not an American soldier himself, never had been. But he <i>was</i> an American. And although he had neither responsibility for nor relationship with the U.S. military, he'd seen years of images on television of carnage just like that which was happening before him, and it both sickened and angered him to the very limits of his considerable self-control.</p><p>The men around the aircraft began to undulate as one. In the glare from the heat pouring out of the arid earth between his overwatch and the crash site, it took him a moment to grasp what was happening, but soon he recognized the inevitable outpouring of gleeful emotion from the butchers around the downed helicopter.</p><p>The bastards were dancing over the bodies.</p><p>Gentry unwrapped his finger from the trigger guard of the huge Barrett and let his fingertip stroke the smooth trigger. His laser range finder told him the distance, and a small group of canvas tents between himself and the dance party flapped in the breeze and gave him an idea of the windage.</p><p>But he knew better than to fire the Barrett. If he charged the weapon and pulled the trigger, he would kill a couple of shitheads, yes, but the area would turn so hot in an instant with news of a sniper in the sector that every postpubescent male with a gun and a mobile phone would be on his ass before he made it to within five miles of his extraction. Gentry's exfiltration would be called off, and he would have to make his own way out of the kill zone.</p><p>No, Gentry told himself. A meager measure of payback would be righteous, but it would set off a bigger shit storm than he was prepared to deal with.</p><p>Gentry was not a gambler. He was a private assassin, a hired gun, a contract operator. He could frag a half dozen of these pricks as fast as he could lace his boots, but he knew such retribution would not be worth the cost.</p><p>He spat a mixture of saliva and sand on the ground in front of him and turned to put the huge Barrett back in its case.</p><br><p>The camera crew from Al Jazeera had been smuggled over the border from Syria a week earlier with the sole purpose of chronicling an Al Qaeda victory in northern Iraq. The videographer, the audio technician, and the reporter/producer had been moved along an AQ route, had slept in AQ safe houses alongside the AQ cell, and they'd filmed the launch of the missile, the impact with the Chinook, and the resulting fireball in the sky.</p><p>Now they recorded the ritualistic decapitation of an already dead American soldier. A middle--aged man with handwritten name tape affixed to his body armor that read, "Phillips&#x2014;Mississippi National Guard." Not one of the camera crew spoke English, but they all agreed they had clearly just recorded the destruction of an elite unit of CIA commandos.</p><p>The customary praise of Allah began with the dancing of the fighters and the firing of the weapons into the air. Although the AQ cell numbered only sixteen, there were over thirty armed men now in step with one another in front of the smoldering metal hulk in the street. The videographer focused his lens on a moqtar, a local chieftain, dancing in the center of the festivities. Framing him perfectly in front of the wreckage, his flowing white dishdasha contrasting magnificently with the black smoke billowing up behind him. The moqtar bounced on one foot over the decapitated American, his right hand above him swinging a bloody scimitar into the air.</p><p>This was the money shot. The videographer smiled and did his best to remain professional, careful to not follow along with the rhythm and dance in celebration of the majesty of Allah to which he and his camera now bore witness.</p><p>The moqtar shouted into the air with the rest. "Allahu Akhbar!" <i>God is greater!</i> He hopped in euphoria with the masked foreigners, his thick facial hair opened to reveal a toothy smile as he looked down at the burnt and bloody piece of dead American meat lying in the street below him.</p><p>The crew from Al Jazeera shouted in ecstasy as well. And the videographer filmed it all with a steady hand.</p><p>He was a pro; his subject remained centered, his camera did not tremble or flinch.</p><p>Not until the moment when the moqtar's head snapped to the side, burst open like a pressed grape, and sinew, blood, and bone spewed violently in all directions.</p><p><i>Then </i>the camera flinched.</p><br><p>Gentry just couldn't help himself.</p><p>He fired round after round at the armed men in the&nbsp; crowd, and all the while he cussed aloud at his lack of discipline, because he knew he was throwing his own timetable, his entire operation out the window. Not that he could hear his own curses. Even with his earplugs, the report of the Barrett was deafening as he sent huge projectiles downrange, one after another, the&nbsp; blowback from the rifle's muzzle break propelling sand and debris from the ground around him up and into his face and arms.</p><p>As he paused to snap a second heavy magazine into the rifle, he took stock of his situation. From a tradecraft perspective, this was the single dumbest move he could have made, virtually shouting to the insurgents around him that their mortal enemy was here in their midst.</p><p>But damn if it did not <i>feel</i> like the right thing to do. He resecured the big rifle in the crook of his shoulder, already throbbing from the recoil, sighted on the downed chopper site, and resumed his righteous payback. Through the big scope he saw body parts spin through the air as another huge bullet found the midsection of a masked gunman.</p><p>This was simple revenge, nothing more. Gentry knew his actions altered little in the scope of things, apart from changing a few sons of bitches from solids into liquids. His body continued firing into the now scattering murderers, but his mind was already worrying about his immediate future. He wouldn't even try for the LZ now. Another chopper in the area would be a target too good for the angry AQ survivors to ignore. No, Gentry decided, he would go to ground: find a drainage culvert or a little wadi, cover himself in dirt and debris, lie all day in the heat, and ignore hunger and bug bites and his need to piss.</p><p>It was going to suck.</p><p>Still, he reasoned as he slammed the third and final magazine into the smoking rifle, his poor decision did serve some benefit. A half dozen dead shitheads <i>are</i>, after all, a half dozen dead shitheads.</p></p><h2>Beat the Blues Before They Beat You: How to Overcome Depression</h2><p>Over the past year, 16.5 million Americans&#x2014;1 in 13 adults&#x2014;of every race, age, and socioeconomic class experienced at least one major bout of depression.

Tour.</p><p><p>J. A. Jance is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of the J. P. Beaumont series, the Joanna Brady series, the Ali Reynolds series, and five interrelated thrillers about the Walker family, as well as a volume of poetry. Born in South Dakota and brought up in Bisbee, Arizona, Jance lives with her husband in Seattle, Washington, and Tucson, Arizona.</p>This is one of the latest in the long-running, justifiably famous J.P. Beaumont homicide detective series. The setting this time is the Shakespeare festival in Ashland, Oregon. We learn about Beaumont&#39;s family, friends and life as he investigates a theatrical murder, this time as a bystander--a much more difficult position from which to look into the case. Engene has recorded a number of Jance&#39;s detective novels. His gruff yet expressive and sensitive voice is a wonderful match for the detective, but he is equally skilled with the other male and female characters. The fast-paced, well-modulated reading is easy to follow. This is a wonderful addition to recorded mysteries. E.F.

The message came from a maudlin TV commercial for the Muscular Dystrophy Association that featured a boy who looked a lot like her. Then as now, Johnson tended to draw her own conclusions. In secret, she carried the knowledge of her mortality with her and tried to sort out what it meant. By the time she realized she wasn't a dying child, she was living a grown-up life, intensely engaged with people, politics, work, struggle, and community.<br><br>Due to a congenital neuromuscular disease, Johnson has never been able to walk, dress, or bathe without assistance. With help, however, she manages to take on the world. From the streets of Havana, where she covers an international disability rights conference, to the floor of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, to an auditorium at Princeton, where she defends her right to live against philosopher Peter Singer, she lives a life on her own terms. And along the way, she defies and debunks every popular assumption about disability. <br><br>This unconventional memoir opens with a lyrical meditation on death and ends with a surprising sermon on pleasure. In between, we get the tales Johnson most enjoys telling from her own life. This is not a book "about disability" but it will surprise anyone who has ever imagined that life with a severe disability is inherently worse than another kind of life.<br></p><p>Harriet McBryde Johnson has been a lawyer in Charleston, South Carolina, since 1985. Her solo practice emphasizes benefits and civil rights claims for poor and working people with disabilities. For more than twenty-five years, she has been active in the struggle for social justice, especially disability rights. She holds the world endurance record (thirteen years without interruption) for protesting the Jerry Lewis telethon for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. She served the City of Charleston Democratic Party for eleven years, first as secretary, then as chair. She is a regular contributor to <i>The New York Times Magazine </i>and to the disability press and lives in Charleston, South Carolina.<br>From <i>Too Late to Die Young</i>:<br>Susan gets me on gospel radio because she likes the guys at the station. They're jokey and jivey and very Christian. I like their studio. It's all eight-track, 1970s technology. No fancy electronics here; the engineer turns dials and flicks mechanical switches. On one of their cartridges that's been reused and relabeled countless times, I lay down my spot: <br><br>I'm Harriet McBryde Johnson. I'm running for Charleston County Council.<br><br>You might know me as the wheelchair lawyer who pickets the telethon. People ask me why I do that. The answer is, human dignity is not for sale. <br><br>Why am I running for County Council? Because government, too, should treat every citizen with dignity and respect.<br><br>When the base closes, what kind of community will we be?

The book explores the significance of falling deeply in love with the woman who was to become his muse, and the profound sense of loss he felt when their relationship came to an end, and how the loss affected him both personally and creatively. A leader of the folk revival in both Britain and America, the book recounts how he rose to be an international star, releasing songs such as &#34;Mellow Yellow&#34; and &#34;Catch the Wind&#34;, and his most successful album, &#34;Sunshine Superman&#34;. Donovan is acknowledged as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 1960&#39;s. The book provides a frank account of his early experiments with drugs and his search for self.

He is widely recognised as a founder of 'Flower Power' and travelled to India with The Beatles to meditate under the guidance of the Maharishi. He currently lives in Ireland with his wife Linda and continues to write poetry and music.<b>Chapter One</b><br> <br><i>Childhood<br></i>Glasgow, 1954<br><br>I liked the danger wi' Harry. Ah was limpin', runnin' wi' Harry Cadbury across the back of St. Vincent Street. We were in a battle, lobbin' tin-can grenades over the line at the Anderson Gang. The cans were filled with cold ashes from the tenement refuse. We made the sound of explosions and felt brave.<br><br>Lots of the buildin's in Glasgow were skeletons from the bombing. Harry and me collected shell cases from the rubble of a World War: Spitfires and Hurricanes, Messerschmitts and Heinkels.<br><br>Oor wee battle over, we climbed the wall intae a ruined tenement---against the rules. The weak Scottish sun shone on the wallpapered bedrooms, open tae the sky, the mouths of the dead fireplaces gaping.<br><br>I was in a bedroom wi' half a floor and the ceiling caving in. Balancing on a joist, I found a cupboard and opened it. Inside was an old flower vase which had escaped damage. Inside the vase was a collection of Victorian "scraps," printed scenes of cherubs and young ladies in long dresses and muffs. I was amazed at this find. Harry was a rough-and-tumble Catholic kid. I was a sensitive Proddie boy. Harry saw how much the scraps might get whilst I saw Art and pretty girls to dream on.<br><br>Noo Harry was hanging oot a top-floor windae, tearin' the lead pipe from the eaves. His daddy had taught him this. Soon we had a fire in the back, splintered wood doors and windaes, paint bubblin' in the flames. Harry cut the lead into small pieces and smelted them in an old tin can. He poured the molten metal into ingots on a house brick. The company name came oot reversed. I was amazed.<br><br>The city night fell early in the northern wintery sky. Lights in the windaes shone in the dark tenements. Hungry yins (ones) called up to their mammies for a "piece 'n, jam." Bread spread with jam or butter and sugar flew doon from the kitchen sill, wrapped in newspaper. We crunched the sugar in our mooths, red-faced and hands tingling from the cold.<br><br>Efter a time, the windaes opened up again and the mammies called across the dark world.<br><br>"Are ye there, Harry?"<br><br>"Donovan, come up tae yer bed right now!"<br><br>I used to sleep wi' ma mammy. Daddy used to wake me up to kiss me good night, the smell of machine oil on his dungarees. He worked during and after the war as a tool setter in the Rolls-Royce factory that produced the Merlin engine for the Spitfire. He was a self-taught man. He might have made a scholar, had he not been born a poor boy, barefoot and underpaid. Mammy worked as a factory girl.<br><br>Donnie and Wynn had waited to begin a family, marrying in 1942, mammy at twenty-six and Daddy thirty. The ceremony was conducted in the side chapel of the Catholic church, as was the custom when a Protestant married a Catholic woman. Wynn was a young beauty who loved to dance, as did all the "Big Band Generation" and you could<br><br>See them doon the Barra-Land<br><br>Wi' frizzed and shinny hair<br><br>A blondie Ginger Rogers<br><br>And a skinny Fred Astaire.<br><br>---Donovan Leitch, "Glasgow Town"<br><br>The Second World War ended in the spring of 1945, but it wasn't until Hiroshima and Nagasaki were vaporized that all the Earth stopped fighting. I was conceived the August of that nuclear holocaust.<br><br>In the disruption following the Second World War, three epidemics swept the city: scarlet fever, diphtheria, and polio. The children were hardest hit. The vaccines were too strong, and I was actually given the polio disease this way. So my right leg began to show signs of "wasting." An operation was performed, cutting the Achilles tendon in the foot, and I wore an ugly leg brace for some time after. It was a long boot made of a hard substance that I wore only at night to give the little leg support. Removing the device would tear the hairs and hurt so much that I cried each morning, painful for my mammy and daddy to watch.<br><br>My limpy leg did not hurt, but I could not run fast with the gang so daddy bought a wee two-wheeled pram with a long handle and the boys whizzed me around the back screaming, "The injuns are comin', the injuns'll get ye."<br><br>I got battered by some boys. I didn't fight back. Harry had to fight for me. I jist hiftae find anither way tae beat the boys, I thought.<br><br>Daddy would cradle me in his arms and read poetry to me: Robert Service, W. H. Davies, and the Romantics, Shelley, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, and the Visionaries, Blake, Yeats, and, not forgetting the Shakespeare of Scotland, our own Robert Burns. His uncanny memory retained long monologues and difficult poems, a traditional talent of the Celtic race. Oh, how my bardic father would intone magic poems of wandering. He opened a mysterious door to the other world of vision.<br><br>One day I turned from my game on the linoleum to see my silver-tongued daddy standing in the doorway, his lips pursed in a smile. He winked at me. I tried to wink back but closed both eyes instead. When I opened them again, he was dressed in a fur parka with sealskin boots and mittens, a mischievous twinkle still in his eye. The parlor had disappeared, snow-capped mountains gleamed in the distance. As my Klondike daddy spoke, poetry came out of his beard in puffs of frozen air, snatches of Robert Service. When he got to the bit about Sam McGee being cremated, I closed my eyes again. I was feart. But Daddy was not feart. He was brave enough to dream. He was telling me it is okay to dream.<br><br>At the age of five I stopped sleeping in Mammy's bed, and instead slept alone in the front room on a convertible sofa covered with brown "American" cloth. The high Edwardian room had a dark plywood dressing table and a wardrobe in the 1940s style, soft and curvy. I remember the tall sash windows and a mood of somber stillness as I lay alone in bed, watching the silhouettes of the passing trams in St. Vincent Street moving across the ceiling.<br><br>Across the tramlines was a comic store that sold Superboy, Green Lantern, and the mysterious Mandrake The Magician, and cousin Billy would come round to swop issues with me. I remember my cousin Billy was an artist and he made a drawing for me of a graveyard with old-fashioned soldiers burying an infantryman. I was fascinated to see the drawing of the soul leaving the body. This image is as clear to me now as when I first saw it.<br><br>There was a big cupboard in my room where Daddy went to make pictures in his darkroom. He liked to take pictures of weddings and something called a "bar mitzvah." I didn't go into the darkroom without knocking. Sometimes Daddy let me stand and watch the white paper in the china tray slip about in the thick water. The magic pictures came from nowhere, and I thought ma daddy so fine to do this. He never said a word. It was so peaceful in there, his secret place.<br><br>One night, when he was not making pictures, I slipped into the darkroom and took down a large manual from the shelves. The pages opened at a lovely young woman in the nude. She was smiling, her eyes laughing and her toes painted. I couldn't stop staring at her soft curves. She stepped out of the book and slid next to me in my bed, her long wavy hair falling over my face as she held me close to her wonderful breasts.<br><br>At the back of the posh row of flats at the other end of our street was a large walled garden called The Henney. One morning, Harry and I were peering into the garden through a hole in the old stonework. A little girl was playing on the lawn---We'd never seen grass anywhere else than the park. She was pretty and skipped up to see the scruffy boys. She lifted her skirt and we gave her a mud pack on her wee girls willy. After school, Mammy was very serious and held my hand as we knocked on the posh door. I was told off for doing a bad thing. I didn't understand.<br><br>Two weeks later, unrepentant, I stood in the dark "close" while an older girl lifted her skirt and pulled her knickers down to show me her smooth quim, fine red hairs, sleek and silky. I was amazed when she then peed in a bottle. Afterwards, Harry said that one of the boys had got television. We all went up to see the wee shiny square of glass in the big wooden sideboard. It was just like the pictures but black and white and not so much fun. We got bored and played in the dark. I thought of the big girl and hoped no one told.<br><br>My mammy was the second eldest of seven sisters and two brothers. Her father, Michael Philips, had died soon after the First World War. Mustard gas had damaged his lungs and eventually killed him. They should have received the War Pension but the doctors insisted it was tuberculosis, so the family had only the Widow's Pension, and all the children had to work.<br><br>They fought for country, fought for King,<br><br>They won the war, it's true,<br><br>Tae see Germany and Japan,<br><br>Ye widnae think it noo.<br><br>---Donovan Leitch, "Glasgow Town"<br><br>My daddy was the eldest of two brothers and two sisters. His mother had married twice and outlived both husbands and was known to me as Granny Kelly. She lived on the other side of town, and I remember her dark wee kitchen where we took tea and scones. Uncle Bill still lived with Granny. It was through handsome Uncle Bill that I first heard American folk music. Bill would dress in full tartan sometimes, a silver dirk in his hairy sock. I was surprised to hear later from Scottish comedian Billy Connolly that he knew Bill as "Postie," a figure of some renown in Glasgow.<br><br>I often stayed with my Granny Philips in Argyle Street. Sometimes on Saturday nights when Mammy and Daddy were out dancing, Granny held me over the windowsill two floors up over the street, which frightened my parents, but she did it with all the grandchildren.<br><br>Granny was a big woman with tattooed arms. I remember a name of a dead husband in a freckled heart. She had long black hair, streaked with silver. Below us the Saturday night drunks were raving. One night a man was crawling along the pavement, clawing the paving stones, absolutely "legless" as they say.<br><br>Another night, at a pub over the road, it was kicking-out time and a ...</p><h2>Campo Santo</h2><p>Campo Santo is a collection of essays by W. G. Sebald When W.G. Sebald died tragically in 2001 a unique voice was silenced. Campo Santo is a collection of the pieces he left behind - none of them previously published in book form - which provide a powerful insight into the themes that came to dominate his life. Four pieces pay tribute to Corsica, weaving elegiacally between past and present. Sebald also examines the works of writers such as Kafka, Nabokov, and G�nter Grass, showing both how literature can provide restitution for the injustices of the world and how such literature came to have so great an influence on him. Campo Santo is a fitting memorial to W.G.

Allen and Polmar (Rickover: Controversy and Genius) counter that the Japanese were not ready to surrender until after the second bomb was dropped. Accordingly, massive Allied landings on Japan's home islands thus remained a probability until very late in the war. The secret plan for this invasion, along with the Japanese plan for opposing it, are presented here for the first time. Experts predicted that the Americans would suffer at least half a million casualties, while critics have suggested that this figure was inflated to justify dropping the bomb. The authors have uncovered evidence to support the prediction: for example, the requisition of 370,000 Purple Heart medals by the Quartermaster Corps, indicating the number of wounded expected; 130,000 killed in action would fit the average war dead/wounded ratio, for a total of about 500,000 casualties. Finally, Allen and Polmar convincingly argue that Truman actively sought ways to end the conflict at the lowest cost of American and Japanese lives. This is a convincing case to settle a long-running controversy. History Book Club alternate. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Complementing Stanley Weintraub's excellent <i>The Last Great Victory</i> , this well-shaped work outlines the course that the brass thought the fighting would take through late 1946, the time slated for Japan's defeat. Scenarios ranged from the enemy's sudden collapse to its suicidal resistance, a{&nbsp;}la Okinawa. The Americans knew from codebreaking that the former was not likely and that the latter was certain if an invasion was ordered. Key to the planning, and the subsequent controversy over the atomic bomb, was the expected scale of American casualties. The authors review the estimates, the upper range of which compelled the search for an alternative to a ground battle. Here, Allen and Polmar deploy their complete research by describing the generals' thinking about B-29 bombings, about landing beaches and deception schemes, and about what tactical weapons to use: these might have included poison gas, so anxious were the Americans to minimize casualties. A Japanese plan for maximizing the bloodbath, using the kamikaze, gas, and germ warfare, portended a frightful crescendo that fortunately remains speculative, but this encompassing narrative--fit for all libraries--constitutes the war's "unwritten" final chapter <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Lonely Planet Tunisia (Country Guide)</h2><p><b>Discover Tunisia</b><br><br>Squint in awe at the glinting-gold El-Jem Colosseum and imagine the bloodthirsty roar as Roman gladiators entertain the crowd.<br>Float in startlingly clear seas at El-Mansourah Beach.<br>Wear your fragrant jasmine flower with confidence you're sending the right message.<br>Sway gracefully on camelback through the endless Sahara, willing your steed not to break into a trot.<br><br><b>In This Guide</b><br><br> Four authors, 73 days of in-country research, 70 detailed maps, 102 plates of salade mechouia, one rented camel.<br> New Arts &amp; Architecture chapter.<br> Top Tunisian chef Rafik Tlatli gives an expert take on the local cuisine.<br>Content updated daily: visit <i><b>lonelyplanet.com</b></i> for up-to-the-minute reviews, updates and traveler suggestions.</p><p><b>Who We Are</b><br> At Lonely Planet, we see our job as inspiring and enabling travellers to connect with the world for their own benefit and for the benefit of the world at large. <br> <br> <p><b>What We Do</b><br> * We offer travellers the world's richest travel advice, informed by the collective wisdom of over 350 Lonely Planet authors living in 37 countries and fluent in 70 languages.<br> * We are relentless in finding the special, the unique and the different for travellers wherever they are.<br> * When we update our guidebooks, we check every listing, in person, every time. <br> * We always offer the trusted filter for those who are curious, open minded and independent.<br> * We challenge our growing community of travellers; leading debate and discussion about travel and the world.<br> * We tell it like it is without fear or favor in service of the travellers; not clouded by any other motive. <br> </p><p><br> <b>What We Believe</b><br> We believe that travel leads to a deeper cultural understanding and compassion and therefore a better world.</p>Lonely Planet guides are a must-pack&#x201d; --Toronto Star, February 2006<br></p><h2>American Girl Ultimate Visual Guide: Expanded Edition Book</h2><p>EXCELLENT CONDITION, OWNER SIGNATURE DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH CONDITION.</p><p></p><h2>The Aesthetic Dimension: Toward a Critique of Marxist Aesthetics (English and German Edition)</h2><p>Scorning the debasement of art by an escapist elite in capitalist countries and the abuse of art to glorify the socialist state, the influential social theorist presents a dialectical aesthetic in which art functions as the conscience of society</p><p>Best known as author of <i>One-Dimensional Man</i> and <i>Eros and Civilization,</i>&nbsp;Herbert Marcuse (1896-1979) was a founder of the Frankfurt School of critical theory.

By the time he was thirteen, he was the leader of a band of bloodthirsty thugs. By fifteen, he intends to be king... It&#39;s time for Prince Honorous Jorg Ancrath to return to the castle he turned his back on, to take what&#39;s rightfully his. Since the day he was hung on the thorns of a briar patch and forced to watch Count Renar&#39;s men slaughter his mother and young brother, Jorg has been driven to vent his rage. Life and death are no more than a game to him-and he has nothing left to lose. But treachery awaits him in his father&#39;s castle. Treachery and dark magic. No matter how fierce, can the will of one young man conquer enemies with power beyond his imagining?</p><p><b>Mark Lawrence</b> is a research scientist working on artificial intelligence.

Always the ravens. They settled on the gables of the church even before the injured became the dead. Even before Rike had finished taking fingers from hands, and rings from fingers. I leaned back against the gallows-post and nodded to the birds, a dozen of them in a black line, wise-eyed and watching.</p><p>The town-square ran red. Blood in the gutters, blood on the flagstones, blood in the fountain. The corpses posed as corpses do. Some comical, reaching for the sky with missing fingers, some peaceful, coiled about their wounds. Flies rose above the wounded as they struggled. This way and that, some blind, some sly, all betrayed by their buzzing entourage.</p><p>'Water! Water!' It's always water with the dying. Strange&#x2014;it's killing that gives me a thirst.</p><p>And that was Mabberton. Two hundred dead farmers lying with their scythes and axes. You know, I warned them that we do this for a living. I said it to their leader, Bovid Tor. I gave them that chance, I always do. But no. They wanted blood and slaughter. And they got it.</p><p>War, my friends, is a thing of beauty. Those as says otherwise are losing. If I'd bothered to go over to old Bovid, propped up against the fountain with his guts in his lap, he'd probably take a contrary view. But look where disagreeing got him.</p><p>'Shit-poor farm maggots,' Rike discarded a handful of fingers over Bovid's open belly. He came to me, holding out his takings, as if it was my fault. 'Look! One gold ring. One! A whole village and one fecking gold ring. I'd like to set the bastards up and knock 'em down again. Fecking bog-farmers.'</p><p>He would too: he was an evil bastard, and greedy with it. I held his eye. 'Settle down, Brother Rike. There's more than one kind of gold in Mabberton.'</p><p>I gave him my warning look. His cursing stole the magic from the scene; besides, I had to be stern with him. Rike was always on the edge after a battle, wanting more. I gave him a look that told him I had more. More than he could handle. He grumbled, stowed his bloody ring, and thrust his knife back in his belt.</p><p>Makin came up then and flung an arm about each of us, clapping gauntlet to shoulder-plate. If Makin had a skill, then smoothing things over was it.</p><p>'Brother Jorg is right, Little Rikey. There's treasure aplenty to be found.' He was wont to call Rike 'Little Rikey', on account of him being a head taller than any of us and twice as wide. Makin always told jokes. He'd tell them to those as he killed, if they gave him time. Liked to see them go out with a smile.</p><p>'What treasure?' Rike wanted to know, still surly.</p><p>'When you get farmers, what else do you always get, Little Rikey?' Makin raised his eyebrows all suggestive.</p><p>Rike lifted his visor, treating us to his ugly face. Well brutal more than ugly. I think the scars improved him. 'Cows?'</p><p>Makin pursed his lips. I never liked his lips, too thick and fleshy, but I forgave him that, for his joking and his deathly work with that flail of his. 'Well, you can have the cows, Little Rikey. Me, I'm going to find a farmer's daughter or three, before the others use them all up.'</p><p>They went off then, Rike doing that laugh of his&#x2014;'hur, hur, hur'&#x2014;as if he was trying to cough a fishbone out.</p><p>I watched them force the door to Bovid's place opposite the church, a fine house, high roofed with wooden slates and a little flower garden in front. Bovid followed them with his eyes, but he couldn't turn his head.</p><p>I looked at the ravens, I watched Gemt and his half-wit brother, Maical, taking heads, Maical with the cart and Gemt with the axe. A thing of beauty, I tell you. At least to look at. I'll agree war smells bad. But, we'd torch the place soon enough and the stink would all turn to wood-smoke. Gold rings? I needed no more payment.</p><p>'Boy!' Bovid called out, his voice all hollow like, and weak.</p><p>I went to stand before him, leaning on my sword, tired in my arms and legs all of a sudden. 'Best speak your piece quickly, farmer. Brother Gemt's a-coming with his axe. Chop-chop.'</p><p>He didn't seem too worried. It's hard to worry a man so close to the worm-feast. Still it irked me that he held me so lightly and called me 'boy'. 'Do you have daughters, farmer? Hiding in the cellar maybe? Old Rike will sniff them out.'</p><p>Bovid looked up sharp at that, pained and sharp. 'H-how old are you, boy?'</p><p>Again the 'boy'. 'Old enough to slit you open like a fat purse,' I said, getting angry now. I don't like to get angry. It makes me angry. I don't think he caught even that. I don't think he even knew it was me that opened him up not half an hour before.</p><p>'Fifteen summers, no more. Couldn't be more...' His words came slow, from blue lips in a white face.</p><p>Out by two, I would have told him, but he'd gone past hearing. The cart creaked up behind me, and Gemt came along with his axe dripping.</p><p>'Take his head,' I told them. 'Leave his fat belly for the ravens.'</p><p>Fifteen! I'd hardly be fifteen and rousting villages.</p><p>By the time fifteen came around, I'd be King!</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>Mabberton burned well. All the villages burned well that summer. Makin called it a hot bastard of a summer, too mean to give out rain, and he wasn't wrong. Dust rose behind us when we rode in; smoke when we rode out.</p><p>'Who'd be a farmer?' Makin liked to ask questions.</p><p>'Who'd be a farmer's daughter?' I nodded toward Rike, rolling in his saddle, almost tired enough to fall out, wearing a stupid grin and a bolt of samite cloth over his half-plate. Where he found samite in Mabberton I never did get to know.</p><p>'Brother Rike does enjoy his simple pleasures,' Makin said.</p><p>He did. Rike had a hunger for it. Hungry like the fire.</p><p>The flames fair ate up Mabberton. I put the torch to the thatched inn, and the fire chased us out. Just one more bloody day in the years' long death throes of our broken empire.</p><p>Makin wiped at his sweat, smearing himself all over with soot-stripes. He had a talent for getting dirty, did Makin. 'You weren't above those simple pleasures yourself, Brother Jorg.'</p><p>I couldn't argue there. 'How old are you?' that fat farmer had wanted to know. Old enough to pay a call on his daughters. The fat girl had a lot to say, just like her father. Screeched like a barn owl: hurt my ears with it. I liked the older one better. She was quiet enough. So quiet you'd give a twist here or there just to check she hadn't died of fright. Though I don't suppose either of them was quiet when the fire reached them...</p><p>Gemt rode up and spoiled my imaginings.</p><p>'The Baron's men will see that smoke from ten miles. You shouldn'ta burned it.' He shook his head, his stupid mane of ginger hair bobbing this way and that.</p><p>'Shouldn'ta,' his idiot brother joined in, calling from the old grey. We let him ride the old grey with the cart hitched up. The grey wouldn't leave the road. That horse was cleverer than Maical.</p><p>Gemt always wanted to point stuff out. 'You shouldn'ta put them bodies down the well, we'll go thirsty now.' 'You shouldn'ta killed that priest, we'll have bad luck now.' 'If we'd gone easy on her we'd have a ransom from Baron Kennick.' I just ached to put my knife through his throat. Right then. Just to lean out and plant it in his neck. 'What's that? What say you, Brother Gemt? Bubble, bubble? Shouldn'ta stabbed your bulgy old Adam's apple?'</p><p>'Oh no!' I cried, all shocked like. 'Quick, Little Rikey, go piss on Mabberton. Got to put that fire out.'</p><p>'Baron's men will see it,' said Gemt, stubborn and red-faced. He went red as a beet if you crossed him. That red face just made me want to kill him even more. I didn't, though. You got responsibilities when you're a leader. You got a responsibility not to kill too many of your men. Or who're you going to lead?</p><p>The column bunched up around us, the way it always did when something was up. I pulled on Gerrod's reins and he stopped with a snicker and a stamp. I watched Gemt and waited. Waited until all thirty-eight of my brothers gathered around, and Gemt got so red you'd think his ears would bleed.</p><p>'Where we all going, my brothers?' I asked, and I stood in my stirrups so I could look out over their ugly faces. I asked it in my quiet voice and they all hushed to hear.</p><p>'Where?' I asked again. 'Surely it isn't just me that knows? Do I keep secrets from you, my brothers?'</p><p>Rike looked a bit confused at this, furrowing his brow. Fat Burlow came up on my right, on my left the Nuban with his teeth so white in that soot-black face. Silence.</p><p>'Brother Gemt can tell us. He knows what should be and what is.' I smiled, though my hand still ached with wanting my dagger in his neck. 'Where we going, Brother Gemt?'</p><p>'Wennith, on the Horse Coast,' he said, all reluctant, not wanting to agree to anything.</p><p>'Well and good. How we going to get there? Near forty of us on our fine oh-so-stolen horses?'</p><p>Gemt set his jaw. He could see where I was going.</p><p>'How we going to get there, if we want us a slice of the pie while it's still nice and hot?' I asked.</p><p>'Lich Road!' Rike called out, all pleased that he knew the answer.</p><p>'Lich Road,' I repeated, still quiet and smiling. 'What other way could we go?' I looked at the Nuban, holding his dark eyes. I couldn't read him, but I let him read me.</p><p>'Ain't no other way.'</p><p>Rike's on a roll, I thought, he don't know what game's being played, but he likes his part.</p><p>'Do the Baron's men know where we're going?' I asked Fat Burlow.</p><p>'War dogs follow the front,' he said. Fat Burlow ain't stupid. His jowls quiver when he speaks, but he ain't stupid.</p><p>'So...' I looked around them, real slow-like. 'So, the Baron knows where bandits such as ourselves will be going, and he knows the way we've got to go.' I let that sink in. 'And I just lit a bloody big fire that tells him and his what a bad idea it'd be to follow.'</p><p>I stuck Gemt with my knife then. I didn't need to, but I wanted it. He danced pretty enough too, bubble bubble on his blood, and fell off his horse. His red face went pale quick enough.</p><p>'Maical,' I said. 'Take his head.'</p><p>And he did.</p><p>Gemt just chose a bad moment.</p><p><b>3</b></p><p>'Two dead, two wrigglers.' Makin wore that big grin of his.</p><p>We'd have camped by the gibbet in any case, but Makin had ridden on ahead to check the ground. I thought the news that two of the four gibbet cages held live prisoners would cheer the brothers.</p><p>'Two,' Rike grumbled. He'd tired himself out, and a tired Little Rikey always sees a gibbet as half empty.</p><p>'Two!' the Nuban hollered down the line.</p><p>I could see some of the lads exchanging coin on their bets. The Lich Road is as boring as a Sunday sermon. It runs straight and level. So straight it gets so as you'd kill for a left turn or a right turn. So level you'd cheer a slope. And on every side, marsh, midges, midges and more marsh. On the Lich Road it didn't get any better than two caged wrigglers on a gibbet.</p><p>Strange that I didn't think to question what business a gibbet had standing out there in the middle of nowhere. I took it as a bounty. Somebody had left their prisoners to die, dangling in cages at the roadside. A strange spot to choose, but free entertainment for my little band nonetheless The brothers were eager, so I nudged Gerrod into a trot. A good horse, Gerrod. He shook off his weariness and clattered along. There's no road like the Lich Road for clattering along.</p><p>'Wrigglers!' Rike gave a shout and they were all racing to catch up.</p><p>I let Gerrod have his head. He wouldn't let any horse get past him. Not on this road. Not with every yard of it paved, every flagstone fitting with the next so close a blade of grass couldn't hope for the light. Not a stone turned, not a stone worn. Built on a bog, mind you!</p><p>I beat them to the wrigglers, of course. None of them could touch Gerrod. Certainly not with me on his back and them all half as heavy again. At the gibbet I turned to look back at them, strung out along the road. I yelled out, wild with the joy of it, loud enough to wake the head-cart. Gemt would be in there, bouncing around at the back.</p><p>Makin reached me first, even though he'd rode the distance twice before.</p><p>'Let the Baron's men come,' I told him. 'The Lich Road is as good as any bridge. Ten men could hold an army here. Them that wants to flank us can drown in the bog.'</p><p>Makin nodded, still hunting his breath.</p><p>'The ones who built this road... if they'd make me a castle&#x2014;' Thunder in the east cut across my words.</p><p>'If the Road-men built castles we'd never get in anywhere,' Makin said. 'Be happy they're gone.'</p><p>We watched the brothers come in. The sunset turned the marsh pools to orange fire, and I thought of Mabberton.</p><p>'A good day, Brother Makin,' I said.</p><p>'Indeed, Brother Jorg,' he said.</p><p>So, the brothers came and set to arguing over the wrigglers. I went and sat against the loot-cart to read while the light stayed with us and the rain held off. The day left me in mind to read Plutarch. I had him all to myself, sandwiched between leather covers. Some worthy monk spent a lifetime on that book. A lifetime hunched over it, brush in hand. Here the gold, for halo, sun, and scrollwork. Here a blue like poison, bluer than a noon sky. Tiny vermilion dots to make a bed of flowers. Probably went blind over it, that monk. Probably poured his life in here, from young lad to grey-head, prettying up old Plutarch's words.</p><p>The thunder rolled, the wrigglers wriggled and howled, and I sat reading words that were older than old before the Road-men built their roads.</p><p>'You're cowards! Women with your swords and axes!' One of the crow-feasts on the gibbet had a mouth on him.</p><p>'Not a man amongst you. All pederasts, trailing up here after that little boy.' He curled his words up at the end like a Merssy-man.</p><p>'There's a fella over here got an opinion about you, Brother Jorg!' Makin called out.</p><p>A drop of rain hit my nose. I closed the cover on Plutarch. He'd waited a while to tell me about Sparta and Lycurgus, he could wait some more and not get wet doing it. The wriggler had more to say and I let him tell it to my back. On the road you've got to wrap a book well to keep the rain out. Ten turns of oilcloth, ten more turns the other way, then stash it under a cloak in a saddlebag. A good saddlebag mind, none of that junk from the Thurtans, good double-stitched leather from the Horse Coast.</p><p>The lads parted to let me up close. The gibbet stank worse than the head-cart, a crude thing of fresh-cut timber. Four cages hung there. Two held dead men. Verydead men. Legs dangling through the bars, raven-pecked to the bone. Flies thick about them, like a second skin, black and buzzing. The lads had taken a few pokes at one of the wrigglers, and he didn't look too cheerful for it. In fact he looked as if he'd pegged it. Which was a waste, as we had a whole night ahead of us, and I'd have said as much, but for the wriggler with the mouth.</p><p>'So now the boy comes over! He's finished looking for lewd pictures in his stolen book.' He sat crouched up in his cage, his feet all bleeding and raw. An old man, maybe forty, all black hair and beard and dark eyes glittering. 'Take the pages to wipe your dung, boy,' he said fierce-lik...</p></p><h2>The Five Stages of Andrew Brawley</h2><p>A heartbreaking yet uplifting story of grief about a boy who has lost everything, but finds new hope drawing in the shadows of a hospital.

The storybook-magic kind.<br> <br>One of the doctors&#x2014;an octopus of a woman working with all eight arms simultaneously&#x2014;cuts away the ruined bits of clothing and peels them back like ragged strips of wallpaper. The boy moans.<br> <br>I turn away. I&#x2019;m not prepared for this. I only came to the ER to say hi to the nurses and see if anyone had blown off a finger while lighting fireworks. Today being the Fourth of July made my chances of seeing a grisly Roman candle accident pretty good.<br> <br>But this is bad. This is so much like that night.<br> <br>The small emergency room can hardly contain all the people crowded in it. The walls are white. The floors are white. The drapes that cordon off the exam rooms are eggshell, except for one space reserved for small children. That curtain is decorated with tiny faded yellow ducks. The nurse&#x2019;s station is a stumbling block perched in the middle of the ER, and all the doctors and nurses are forced to dance around it. The nurses complain, but it&#x2019;s a fixed point in space. Immovable.<br> <br>Like me.<br> <br>My calves ache from crouching, and my shoulders are stiff. I fear that if I move, I&#x2019;ll be seen, and tonight I want to remain invisible. The boy on fire needs me to stay. He needs me to be witness to his pain. It&#x2019;s an odd thought to have, but I&#x2019;m growing used to the odd thoughts that invade my brain these days. Every day.<br> <br>Like how the ER smells remind me of an Italian grinder. The kind that&#x2019;s smothered in vinegar and mayo and too much oregano. Usually the emergency room is a stew of bleach and blood and whatever rotten odors the patients carry in with them. But not tonight. The boy isn&#x2019;t just burned. He&#x2019;s cooked.<br> <br>I turn back to the scene, hoping that they&#x2019;ve finished peeling him. He moves less than before. He cries less. Maybe the doctors gave him something for the pain. Except he and I know that some pain burrows so deep, no narcotic can ever soothe it. It&#x2019;s etched on your bones. It hides in your marrow, like cancer. If the boy survives, this pain is a memory he won&#x2019;t want.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ll remember it for him.<br> <br>Steven startles me from behind. &#x201c;Drew? What&#x2019;re you doing here?&#x201d; Steven is twiggy, with a bulbous nose and a hairline that he left in high school, along with the rest of his good looks.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Steven,&#x201d; I say, playing it nonchalant. I stand up slowly, not taking my eyes off the burning boy, and hide my anxiety behind a lopsided grin. &#x201c;I was on my way home, and I thought I&#x2019;d stop by and say hi.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bad time, kiddo.&#x201d; He&#x2019;s cradling an armful of sterile gauze and looking where I&#x2019;m looking. The boy screams. Steven flinches. Sometimes I think he&#x2019;s too sensitive to be a nurse.<br> <br>I nod my head absently, letting Steven&#x2019;s words settle into my ears but not really hearing them. I try to reply, but the fire in the boy&#x2019;s screams sucks all the oxygen from the room.<br> <br>Steven glances at the bandages in his hands and says, &#x201c;I should go.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m working breakfast tomorrow. See you then?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; Steven&#x2019;s blue eyes light up at the mention of food. &#x201c;Tell Arnold not to undercook the eggs. Runny eggs are disgusting.&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy screeches, and Steven goes. He walks apologetically and disappears into the tumor of people surrounding the boy.<br> <br>I stay. The doctors and nurses press bandages to seared skin. After his airway, fighting infection is their next priority. I can&#x2019;t tell how much of the boy&#x2019;s body is burned, but it&#x2019;s enough. Soon they&#x2019;ll wheel him to another part of the hospital. I might never see him again. I don&#x2019;t even know his name.<br> <br>But I have to go. Death will appear soon, as she always does. She might take the boy, she might not, but I can&#x2019;t be around when she comes. She arrived late before and didn&#x2019;t get me. But she won&#x2019;t make the same mistake twice, and I&#x2019;m not yet ready to leave.<br> <br>No one sees me take off. I navigate the hospital on autopilot. There are doors through which only hospital workers are allowed to pass, but I make my way invisibly. I imagine I can&#x2019;t be seen, and I am not seen. The hospital walls have no memory. They would crumble under the weight of so much suffering. It&#x2019;s better that they forget.<br> <br>On the first floor, far past the surgical ward, is a section of the hospital abandoned in the middle of renovations, left to decay when the economy collapsed and the money ran out. Naked beams and partially erected drywall rot like forgotten bones. Dust and neglect fill the air. No one comes here except me. No one even remembers it exists.<br> <br>I grab the flashlight that I leave by the door. It casts a shallow sphere of illumination. Enough to drive the shadows back, but not enough to banish them completely. Sometimes I try to trick myself, imagining that I&#x2019;m at my old house in my old bed and that the others are asleep in their bedrooms, dreaming sweetly. But it&#x2019;s an illusion that rarely lasts long.<br> <br>This is home now.<br> <br>I trudge to the farthest corner, to the only room that&#x2019;s even remotely finished. It has four walls and a knobless door that I tape shut. Most nights it feels like a prison.<br> <br>My bed against the far wall is a pile of lumpy, stained sheets that embraces me with all the comfort of a sack full of rocks. My pillow is a laundry bag stuffed with discarded scrubs.<br> <br>I pop in my earbuds and play some music. It&#x2019;s in Spanish, so I don&#x2019;t understand the words, but the lazy, metallic twangs of the guitar are soothing. The sounds of the hospital can reach me even here, and I can&#x2019;t sleep with the gasping and wheezing all around me, with the wraiths that haunt the halls, chattering through the night like a million cicadas.<br> <br>Today was long, and I&#x2019;m tired. It&#x2019;s barely eight in the evening, but I can&#x2019;t keep my lids from sliding closed. More often it&#x2019;s the reverse, and I stay awake all night, begging for sleep to take me.<br> <br>Exhaustion is a relief.<br> <br>Before I lie back and let reality slip away, I retrieve a small tin from beneath my pillow. It&#x2019;s the color of sun-kissed skin and weighs less than it should. I dig my fingers around the edges and remove the lid.<br> <br>The first thing that hits me is the rich scent of leather. Old leather. Leather that was loved. I open the faded brown wallet and linger over the picture in the plastic window. Then I fold it closed and put it beside me. Scattered at the bottom of the tin are two gold rings, one toy horse, and a gold cross. I don&#x2019;t touch those.<br> <br>I replace the lid and settle against my makeshift pillow, clutching the wallet and gazing at the picture until I fall asleep.<br> <br>But my last thoughts aren&#x2019;t of the smiling family in the photograph. They&#x2019;re of the boy on fire.</p><h2>The Beaver Hall Group: 1920s Modernism in Montreal</h2><p>Taking their name from the downtown street in Montreal where members shared a studio in the early 1920s, The Beaver Hall Group were early adopters of new modernistic approaches to painting and explored their potential within a variety of genres, including portrait, still life, landscape and prescient scenes of urbanity. As well as providing an artistic window into the modern lives of Canadians during this transformational period of history, as a collective The Beaver Hall Group are exceptional for their inclusion of female artists as core members.

With names such as City of Paris, Penn Traffic, The Maze, Maison Blanche, or The Popular, they suggested spheres far beyond mundane shopping. Nicknames reflected the affection customers felt for their favorites, whether Woodie's, Wanny's, Stek's, O.T.'s, Herp's, or Bam's.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The history of downtown department stores is as fascinating as their names and as diverse as their merchandise. Their stories encompass many themes: the rise of decorative design, new career paths for women, the growth of consumerism, and the technological ingenuity of escalators and pneumatic tubes. Just as the big stores made up their own small universes, their stories are microcosmic narratives of American culture and society.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The big stores were much more than mere businesses. They were local institutions where shoppers could listen to concerts, see fashion shows and art exhibits, learn golf or bridge, pay electric bills, and plan vacations - all while their children played in the store's nursery under the eye of a uniformed nursemaid.<br>From Boston to San Diego and Miami to Seattle, department stores symbolized a city's spirit, wealth, and progressiveness. Situated at busy intersections, they occupied the largest and finest downtown buildings, and their massive corner clocks became popular meeting places. Their locations became the epicenters of commerce, the high point from which downtown property taxes were calculated. Spanning the late 19th century well into the 20th, their peak development mirrors the growth of cities and of industrial America when both were robust and flourishing. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time may be gone when children accompany their mothers downtown for a day of shopping and lunch in the tea room, when monogrammed trucks deliver purchases for free the very same day, and when the personality of a city or town can be read in its big stores. But they are far from forgotten and they still have power to influence how we shop today.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service and Style</i> recreates the days of downtown department stores in their prime, from the 1890s through the 1960s. Exploring in detail the wide range of merchandise they sold, particularly style goods such as clothing and home furnishings, it examines how they displayed, promoted, and sometimes produced goods. It reveals how the stores grew, why they declined, and how they responded to and shaped the society around them.</p><p>Jan Whitaker is a&nbsp;writer and freelance editor based in Amherst, Massachusetts.&nbsp; She is the author of <i>Tea at the Blue Lantern Inn: A Social History of the Tea Room Craze in America</i>.The American department store is "not quite a dinosaur," says Whitaker (<i>Tea at the Blue Lantern Inn</i>), but it has certainly seen better days, and it's that robust era&#x2014;from the turn of the 20th century to the 1960s&#x2014;that she chooses to celebrate in this lively pop history. At their peak, department stores were the nation's largest booksellers and many major chains also sold groceries. But it was clothes that made the stores a prime destination for women of all social classes, and Whitaker discusses at significant length the subtle movements through which major chains from one end of the country to the other cultivated their reputations for being up-to-date with the latest Paris fashions, then tapped into additional markets for young adult and children's wear. More than 100 photographs and illustrations are integrated into the text, aptly demonstrating the lengths to which stores went in order to present themselves as elegant yet modern and convenient. Legendary New York chains like Macy's and Gimbel's get much of the attention, but outposts from other regions, such as San Francisco's Emporium or Philadelphia's Lit Brothers, also get due notice, adding an additional aura of comprehensiveness to Whitaker's richly detailed account. 8-page color insert. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this sequel, Wolf Who Rules, the elven noble whose destiny is intertwined with Tinker, finds himself besieged from all sides. Viceroy and head of the Wind Clan, he had been able to guarantee the safety of everyone in his realm, but faced with an oni invasion, he has had to call in royal troops and relinquish his monopoly of Pittsburgh, which is now entirely stranded on Elfhome. He now struggles to keep the peace between the humans, the newly arrived Stone Clan, the royal forces, a set of oni dragons, the half-oni children who see themselves as human, and the tengu trying to escape their oni enslavement. Meanwhile, Tinker strives to solve the mystery of a growing discontinuity in Turtle Creek. She&#39;s plagued with inexplicable nightmares that may hold the keys to Pittsburgh&#39;s future.

Their honeymoon consists, however, of trying to coordinate the mind-sets of humans and elfkind, both between one another and as lord and lady of Wolf's realm.

The first of these, Village School, was published in 1955, and Miss Read continued to write until her retirement in 1996. In the 1998, she was awarded an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for her services to literature. She lives in Berkshire.To say that for those who like this sort of thing this book is definitely the sort of thing they like is generally understood to be damning with faint praise, but in this case it should be understood as an accolade. Miss Read's loving evocation of life in the Cotswold village of Fairacre tells us that it is possible to go home again, even to a place that does not exist at all, and never did. Fairacre is the English village of our collective unconscious, a thoroughly nostalgic creation. Dora Saint, writing under the nom de plume and in the character of "Miss Read," English schoolteacher, has written 40 books about village and country life. Since the 1950s, Summer at Fairacre and its companion volumes (Village School and Village Centenary) have been reissued many times in England. All three are now being published in the U.S. for the first time in trade paperback. In this particular installment, the central drama such as it is revolves around the bad behavior of Miss Pringle, the crotchety school cleaning lady, who quits in a huff and only returns after much to-ing and fro-ing. Miss Read, a gentle soul with a kindly interest in all around her, is the master of the kind of detail that shows place and character in delicate focus, reporting on the behavior of bees and swallows and Tibby, her cat, and, of course, on her neighbors. For those who miss the Waltons, or who can't get enough of Jan Karon, Fairacre is an excellent place to visit. (May 15)Forecast: Houghton Mifflin is hoping to introduce a whole new generation of readers to Miss Read with these reissues. It may be more of a challenge this time around, but there's no underestimating the power of rural English charm.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Three Beloved Classics by E.B.

A long journey from home. A pregnant mother. The crisis of birth. Remarkable visitors. But there is more. For the first time, here is a drama that accurately presents what the Bible actually says rather than what tradition and mistranslations of Scripture have portrayed. This fresh Christmas drama from world-renowned Middle Eastern and biblical expert Kenneth Bailey is full of wonder and hope. Pastors, Christian educators, musicians and others will welcome the opportunity to present to their congregations this drama of hospitality, grace and joy. Five original contemporary folk songs for guitar and a (SATB) choral anthem are also available to give the production delightful musical accents. InterVarsity Press also provides a PDF download musical score as well as a music CD or MP3 download in which all these songs are performed twice, once with vocals and once with accompaniment only. Without music, the drama can be performed in 25-30 minutes. With music, the performance time is 45-50 minutes. Here is a drama that is biblically accurate, heartwarming and perfectly suited for church performance.</p><p>Kenneth E. Bailey (1930&#x2013;2016) was an acclaimed author and lecturer in Middle Eastern New Testament studies. An ordained Presbyterian minister, he served as Canon Theologian of the Anglican Diocese of Pittsburgh. The author of more than 150 articles in English and in Arabic, his writings include <em>Jesus Through Middle Eastern Eyes</em>, <em>The Good Shepherd</em>, <em>Open Hearts in Bethlehem: A Christmas Drama</em>, and <em>The Cross and the Prodigal</em>. Bailey spent forty years living and teaching in seminaries and institutes in Egypt, Lebanon, Jerusalem and Cyprus. For twenty of those years he was professor of New Testament and head of the Biblical Department of the Near East School of Theology in Beirut where he also founded and directed the Institute for Middle Eastern New Testament Studies. Bailey was also on the faculty of The Ecumenical Institute for Theological Research in Jerusalem. Traveling around the globe to lecture and teach, Bailey spoke in theological colleges and seminaries in England (Oxford, Cambridge, Bristol) Ireland, Canada, Egypt, Finland, Latvia, Denmark, New Zealand, Australia, and Jerusalem. He was active as a Bible teacher for conferences and continuing education events in the Middle East, Europe, and North America, and he taught at Columbia, Princeton, and Fuller Seminary."This fresh Christmas drama from world renowned Middle Eastern and biblical expert Kenneth Bailey is full of wonder and hope. Pastors, Christian educators, musicians and others will welcome the opportunity to present to their congregations this drama of hospitality, grace and joy." (Gail Welborn, Examiner, November 2013)<br><br>"With profound biblical understanding expressed in simple beauty, Ken Bailey combines his gifts with those of son/songwriter David, D. T. Niles and others to help us 'drink from the spring of Scripture as close to the source as possible.' In a world awash in stereotypical Christmas celebrations, don't miss this opportunity to offer Jesus our best." (The Rev. Dr. Paul Detterman, Presbyterians for Renewal/The Fellowship of Presbyterians)<br><br>"Your Christmas program will never be the same once you 'drink from the spring of Scripture' and hear the story of Christ's birth anew through the Middle Eastern insights of Ken Bailey--a master teacher for all ages!" (Emily Brink, senior research fellow, Calvin Institute of Christian Worship)<br><br>"Ken Bailey's scholarship gave "the West" a real treasure in <em>Jesus Through Middle Eastern Eyes.</em> His scholarship and imagination have now given western eyes a new way of looking at the birth of Jesus. Christmas in church has been offered a new and authentic setting--what a gift, what a legacy!" (Fr. Tim Murphy PP, Blessington, Ireland)<br><br>"Ken Bailey retells the Christmas story not only with biblical integrity but with great warmth, wit and wisdom. When this drama was presented, we watched the incarnation become transformed from 'no room at the inn' into an experience of radical hospitality. This imaginative, dramatic script can revitalize the Christmas season in any size congregation." (Susan Andrews, former moderator of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.))<br><br>"Having seen a production of Ken Bailey's <em>Open Hearts in Bethlehem</em> I can say that it is the new and important Christmas play many of us have been longing and waiting for. It reflects Dr. Bailey's lifelong immersion in Middle Eastern culture and his brilliant grasp of theological scholarship. Add to that the beautiful original musical score and the result is a fresh and original approach to the Christmas story. As an actor-director and former professor of theatre I highly recommend this production."

After ten years of working in the Philippine intelligence community, she turned to broadcast journalism. <i>Smaller and Smaller Circles</i>, her first novel, won the Philippine National Book Award.Emil is running after his slum kids, panting in the noonday sun, loosening the high collar of his shirt as he goes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children urge him on, their voices shrill with agitation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not much further, Father Emil!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Over here, this way!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Just a little more!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His fear grows with each step. It tastes like rust, feels gritty like dirt in his mouth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stench from the sea of garbage around them is overpowering. It rained last night, and now that the sun is out, the dump site is steaming. Awful vapors rising lazily with the heat: wet paper and rot and excrement mixing in a soup of odors around them, above them.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&#x2019;d think by now you would be used to this, he tells himself, but you&#x2019;re not. One never gets used to this.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At last they come to a small space about five feet in diameter, where the garbage has been cleared away to expose the older, compost-like layer beneath.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There.&#x201d; One of the children points.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even before he looks in the direction indicated by the thin forefinger, he detects it, a new note of putrescence among all the putrescences mingling in the unwholesome air.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A small, thin, pale hand protrudes from beneath the garbage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mother of God,&#x201d; he mutters under his breath. He turns to the children. &#x201c;Quick, get me a long stick.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three children immediately come forward, offering him the digging sticks they use to poke through the garbage. He takes one and walks grimly toward their discovery.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is about to begin when a flash of concern for the children stabs through the grey, slow-moving haze of fear. He stops, turns around and tells them to leave.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No, Father Emil,&#x201d; they say, first one voice, then many voices. &#x201c;We will stay with you,&#x201d; and in their faces there is a kind of quiet determination and sympathy so grown-up it startles him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secretly he is glad of the company. He does not repeat the order and returns, face set, to the business at hand.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right. Here we go then.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He begins to root through great clumps of garbage, and slowly the thing begins to emerge. He won&#x2019;t look at it yet&#x2014;although he already knows what it is&#x2014;not until he has more or less cleared away the refuse above and around it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he is done, the body of a child emerges. It is a boy about eight to ten years old, though it is difficult for Emil to tell the age accurately. Even at fourteen or fifteen, most of these kids are small, very small, owing to malnutrition and disease.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is lying face down in the muck and completely naked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The smell of it&#x2014;now the dominant note in the vile broth of rot smells; it hangs heavy and horrible in the air.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flies like fat, shiny blue-black beads, buzzing around the body insistently.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emil cannot see any marks or wounds on the back or on the back of the head. Afraid to touch the corpse, he slides one end of the stick underneath the body, just beneath the chest, and uses it as a lever to turn the body over. The deadweight almost breaks the stick in two.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sudden silence among the children is odd. In fact, the whole world seems to Emil to have fallen silent. The neighborhood sounds and the sounds of the traffic from the highway have faded to a strange, low rumble in his ears.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The front of the child&#x2019;s body seems to be moving, and it takes the priest a few seconds to comprehend that there are maggots in it, thousands of them. Gaping wounds&#x2014;no, holes&#x2014;in the chest and stomach.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emil realizes the heart has been removed, the child eviscerated. The genitals are missing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looks at the face. <i>Please, God, let the face remind me this used to be a human being.</i> Another few seconds and he realizes the face is gone, as though it has been scraped off, leaving a mess of jellied eyeball and bone protruding here and there through muscle.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hard to make sense of what is missing, what is left.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purple-brown scabs on the child&#x2019;s knees, probably from an afternoon&#x2019;s rough play.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spell abruptly broken now, the children running, screaming, from the clearing, leaping goatlike over the garbage in terror.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emil turns, staggering away from the body, and throws up until his stomach feels completely empty. It does not seem enough; he still feels sick, and he forces his throat to constrict several times, to no avail.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the tears that stream from his eyes, he sees that three of the older children have remained. They come toward him now, wordlessly take him by the hand and lead him out quietly, gently, through the garbage.</p><h2>Hit and Run</h2><p><p>Keller's a hit man.

From spy in the field to the top ranks of the Company&#39;s career agents, he experienced it all as well as seven different presidential administrations. While Paseman&#39;s account of his long service has enough real-life derring-do to keep the reader engaged, of even greater interest, however, are Paseman&#39;s observation on politics and the CIA, especially how change of presidential administrations could bring sweeping, and often negative changes to the agency.- Johnson - declined to run for a second full term, broken by Vietnam- Nixon - resigned in disgrace after ending Vietnam and opening relations with China- Ford - never elected caretaker - Carter - hoist on the petard of fundamentalist Islam in Iran- Reagan - first full, two-term president since Eisenhower and declared war on the evil empire and brought the USSR to its knees with the threat of a still fanciful Star Wars- Bush the father - &#34;won&#34; the Cold War as the Soviet Union collapsed and &#34;coalitioned&#34; Saddam out of Iraq- Clinton - leader of the new world order, peace in our time, and dead Rangers in the streets of Mogadishu- Bush the son - 9/11, Afghanistan, and IraqIn March 1967 author Paseman joined the CIA following successful service as an army armor officer in Germany.

It focuses on the top skills employers seek when hiring recent college graduates. This comprehensive publication provides a discussion and numerous examples of how to identify, measure, and assess employability skills as an outcome of cocurricular experiences. Organized in two sections, the book charts a course for student affairs colleagues to support students in making the transition from campus to career marketplace. The first section focuses on the skills that are most sought after by employers as reported by the National Association of Colleges and Employers. In addition to an analysis of the political landscape in which this work is conducted, chapters explore how institutions can respond to this demand and how special populations, such as first-generation students, can benefit from intentional efforts to engage them in cocurricular experiences. The second section addresses the development of career-readiness skills in the context of a variety of cocurricular experiences. Participation in student organizations, campus activities, student government, collegiate recreation, service programs, leadership programs, and fraternities and sororities are discussed. Each chapter includes innovative models to address career readiness as well as real-world examples of how students are gaining these important skills through the deep and robust learning taking place within cocurricular experiences. Engagement and Employability is also designed for leaders in higher education beyond student affairs who seek a deeper understanding of the impact of student affairs work on student engagement and post-graduation success. The book masterfully illustrates the importance of cocurricular learning outcomes on students&#39; personal and professional skill development.</p><p></p><h2>The Dragon and the George</h2><p>Through no fault of his own, the once human Jim Eckert had become a dragon.

When the worst storm of the decade descends on Shadeland, Will and his friends must confront unfathomable horrors. Everyone Will loves&#x2014;his mother, his little sister, Mia, and his friends&#x2014;will be threatened. And very few of them will escape with their lives.</p><p>Jonathan Janz grew up between a dark forest and a graveyard, which explains everything. Brian Keene named his debut novel The Sorrows "the best horror novel of 2012." The Library Journal deemed his follow-up, House of Skin, "reminiscent of Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House and Peter Straub's Ghost Story." 2013 saw the publication of his novel of vampirism and demonic possession The Darkest Lullaby, as well as his serialized horror novel Savage Species. Of Savage Species Publishers Weekly said, "Fans of old-school splatterpunk horror--Janz cites Richard Laymon as an influence, and it shows--will find much to relish." Jonathan's Kindle Worlds novel Bloodshot: Kingdom of Shadows marked his first foray into the superhero/action genre. Jack Ketchum called his vampire western Dust Devils a "Rousing-good weird western," and his sequel to The Sorrows (Castle of Sorrows) was selected one of 2014's top three novels by Pod of Horror. 2015 saw the release of The Nightmare Girl, which prompted Pod of Horror to call Jonathan "Horror's Next Big Thing." His newest release is Wolf Land, which Publishers Weekly called &#x201c;gruesome yet entertaining gorefest&#x201d; with &#x201c;an impressive and bloody climax.&#x201d; He has also written four novellas (Exorcist Road, The Clearing of Travis Coble, Old Order, and Witching Hour Theatre) and several short stories. His primary interests are his wonderful wife and his three amazing children, and though he realizes that every author's wife and children are wonderful and amazing, in this case the clich� happens to be true.

You can also find him on Facebook, via @jonathanjanz on Twitter, on Instagram (jonathanjanz) or on his Goodreads and Amazon author pages.Taking care of his six-year-old sister and his mother, who is addicted to drugs, has forced 15-year-old Will to grow up quickly in his small Southern town of Shadeland. Will and his group of outcast friends face the usual torments: bullying by the in-crowd and girls who seem just out of reach. But things are not always what they seem. Mia, the girl of Will's dreams, seems to reciprocate Will's feelings. All goes well&#x2014;until the bullies enter the scene and one of the girls is hauled off into the woods by a monsterlike hand. An intricate intermingled plot involving evil creatures keeps this title from being a typical coming-of-age story. The first half of the novel introduces the characters and backstory, and by then, the mayhem of a serial killer and mystical monsters becomes believable, though readers will be wondering what's going on. The unbelievably irresponsible police officers might be problematic if this book were a more realistic coming-of-age tale, but in a more fantastical genre, they make sense. VERDICT This book will be hit with a wide variety of high school and older middle school students.&#x2014;Jake Pettit, Enka Schools, Istanbul, Turkey</p><h2>The Family from One End Street (Puffin Modern Classics)</h2><p>This is the story of everyday life in the big, happy Ruggles family who live in the small town of Otwell.

Then there&#39;s all the children - practical Lily Rose, clever Kate, mischievous twins James and John, followed by Jo, who loves films, little Peg and finally baby William.

McCoy expertly relays his innermost thoughts and feelings, drawing on his mastery of personal leadership. He understands the intangibles that make up our modern-day warriors, those young Americans on whom we place so much responsibility when we send them into harm&#39;s way. Col McCoy describes the total cost of combat and the price paid by all who choose to become a warrior. By pointing to positive training examples and keying on the effects of situational training, battle drills, conducted prior to and during combat, he successfully trained his Marines and developed the proper habits that would be the difference between life and death during combat. He directed his Marines to become &#34;experts in the application of violence&#34; without sacrificing their humanity. The essence of war is violence and the act of killing legitimate human targets without hesitation. To accomplish this, he instituted meaningful training and used his refined principles as a human being to guide him in the leadership and administration on the moral code that rules the field of battle. He is the perfect example of all that we hold dear in our warrior culture. He loved his men, showed them the right way through his personal example, guided his actions with passion and relayed his feelings to his men completely. He was quick to note his own shortcomings and how he overcame them and was the inspiration to the team that triumphed when all Marines survived the day. Emotionally riveting, The Passion of Command provides inside information into the warrior culture and allows one to grasp the complexities when hardening the mind, body and spirit for the rigors of combat. Most find it hard to communicate the human effects of combat to people who have never experienced the harsh realities associated with actually engaging an enemy. Col McCoy doesn&#39;t have that problem; he opened the door and let the reader in.</p><p></p><h2>Flowers from Shakespeare&#39;s Garden</h2><p>This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the original.

The illustrations are preceded by a short, useful introduction that examines the meaning of this theme, the history of the paintings' production, and the story behind some of the collections for which the paintings were intended. Included are a useful chronology of the artist's life and a wonderful series of photographs of the artist in his studio and at work on these canvases. Yet the reproductions of the paintings themselves form the core of the volume, and they are sumptuous. The volume itself is oversize and includes numerous fold-out pages, giving a sense of the paintings' size and rendering them to scale. The effect is overwhelming.

He currently lives in Greensboro, North Carolina, with his family.Forty million years after humankind has left Earth, the master computer assigned the task of overseeing the colonies sends a group of &#34;chosen&#34; on a journey back home. Stefan Rudnicki tells the story of this journey with a deep, luxurious voice that lends the story a rich authority. Treachery abounds as this small, vulnerable group tries to adapt to hostile environments and negotiate their social hierarchies. Rudnicki&#39;s delivery of the different personalities is judicious. He&#39;s careful not to depict the characters as either good or bad, and this nuance reinforces a central idea in the book: that every member of the group is important for the salvation of the whole. Reconciling differences is imperative not only for their survival, but for the destiny of humankind.

She lives in Los Angeles.One of pop culture's universal truths is that Americans have carried on an unabashed romance with the automobile since its invention around the turn of the twentieth century. This rich, oversize album by a renowned car photographer, who refers to herself as a "classic car junkie," will touch the heartstrings of those who feel the romance of the road. In more than 200 color photographs, Lewis "poses" splendid examples of cars from throughout the history of the American automobile industry at planned locations where cars traditionally "hang out," such as at drive-in restaurants, drive-in movie theaters, motels, and diners, or in desert settings, or with golden fields in the background. These beautiful shots reflect Lewis' conviction that "cars are most themselves in their natural habitat. They belong on the road. And they belong to the road." We see cars in elegant profile or provocative full face; we see luxury cars (Imperial), sports cars (Corvette), and utility cars (Grand Cherokee). The bright, spirited, and informative text provides excellent mortar holding the photographs together. <i>Brad Hooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A veteran of World War I, the Russian Civil War, and the Polish-Russian War of 1920-21, he also was respected as a historian. From 1939 to 1944 he kept a detailed secret journal, making entries daily at first and then, near the end of the occupation, even more frequently. His observations range from matter-of-fact anticipation of war in 1939 to information about his own and other Poles' underground activities. As a whole, the entries reveal his growing recognition that the Nazis intended to destroy Polish culture and all those who had been its bearers.<br>When originally published in Polish, the diary won a major award and soon went into a second edition. Now translated by his son and edited by his grandchildren, Klukowski's diary provides a rare picture of how noncombatants coped with life in German-occupied eastern Poland.<br>Klukowski chronicled births, deaths, deportations, liquidations, partisan actions, and much more. His devotion to detail resulted in an amazingly long list of victims who fell to the German Occupation forces.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: PolishKlukowski's journal entry for May 30, 1943, reads: "We are still afraid of the Germans, but now the Germans are afraid of us." For diarist and reader alike, that observation posits the first realistic hope that the enemy ultimately will be routed. Because of his post as superintendent of a county hospital in southeastern Poland, Klukowski (1885-1959), unlike the Jews and others among his fellow Christians, was not transported to a concentration camp. Near war's end, his virtually depopulated city was already resettled by Germans. A doctor by profession, a writer, historian and book collector by avocation, Klukowski determined to record daily life under the occupation, unflinchingly noting the actions of informers, looters and collaborators, along with the small and large heroisms he witnessed. No matter how familiar the brutality of the Nazis, readers will respond anew to Klukowski's rendering of the round-ups of Jews, of the transports of gentiles to labor camps, of the reprisal killings for sabotage, of the scarcity of food, heat and medicine. The diary is unusual in its depiction of a region's population at large, gentiles as well as Jews, making this a document of historical value. Originally published in Poland in 1958, the book is translated by the author's late son and edited by his American grandchildren.

The Veneration of relics is practiced by Christians and non-Christians alike. It is in no way restricted to the Catholic religion but is, to some extent, a primitive instinct with origins that predate Christianity. It is known that relics of Buddha were distributed soon after his death. The relics of Confucius have been venerated by the people of Asia since the year 195 B.C., and the relics of Mohammed, who died in A.D. 632, are similarly revered. In the Old Testament the relics of the prophet Elisha are mentioned (2 Kings 13:20-21), and the New Testament notes the relics of the Apostle Paul and the wonders the Lord worked through them (Acts 19:11-12). From early Church history there was no extravagance or abuse in honoring relics and, indeed, the practice was taken for granted by writers such as St. Augustine, St. Ambrose, St. Jerome, St. John Chrysostom and other great doctors of the Church without exception. In Relics, Joan Carroll Cruz, author of the bestseller The Incorruptibles, describes in vivid detail the stories, history, and theology of Catholic belief surrounding the veneration of many of the major and active relics that are revered by the Catholic Church - the Shroud of Turin, the True Cross, the Blood of Januarius, the relics of the Blessed Mother, and many more. The role of relics in Catholic life and what the Church teaches about them are revealed and carefully documented in this unique and engrossing account.</p><p>Scripture speaks of miracles wrought through relics: a dead man was raised when Elisha&#x2019;s bones touched him, and the clothing of Jesus and His apostles healed the sick. In the early Church, Masses were celebrated over the bones of the martyrs, and phials of their blood have effected countless miracles. Direct successors of the Apostles themselves speak of venerating relics; Church Fathers encourage it; throughout the ages of Catholic legacy, relics of the saints are always present.&nbsp;The Church takes diligent care in preserving and documenting the authenticity of her relics. Best-selling author Joan Carroll Cruz takes full advantage of these resources. With painstaking research, she exposes the details behind hundreds of the Church&#x2019;s most famous and beloved relics. She covers 38 second-class relicsof our Lord and Lady, such as the Holy Grail and Our Lady&#x2019;s Veil, and relics of all sorts from 75 favorite saints, such as St. Mary Magdalene, St. Agnes, St. Charles Borromeo, St. Francis of Assisi, St. Maria Goretti, and many more!&nbsp;<i>Relics&nbsp;</i>is a unique collection of years of dedicated research about the lives of the saints and the mementos they left behind, to remind us of their presence and intercession for us.&nbsp;Joan Carroll Cruz was a native of New Orleans and was the educational product of the School Sisters of Notre Dame. She attended grade school, high school and college under their tutelage. Mrs. Cruz was a tertiary in the Discalced Carmelite Secular Order (Third Order) since 1968; for eight years she served as Mistress of Formation (Novice Mistress).&nbsp;&nbsp;For her non-fiction books, Joan Carroll Cruz depended heavily on information received from foreign shrines, churches, convents and monasteries. Her books include <i>The Incorruptibles</i>, published in 1977; <i>Desires of Thy Heart</i>, a strongly Catholic-themed novel, also in 1977; <i>Relics</i>, published in 1983; <i>Eucharistic Miracles</i> in 1987; <i>Secular Saints</i> in 1989; Prayers and Heavenly Promises in 1990; Miraculous Images of Our Lady in 1993; <i>Miraculous Images of Our Lord</i> in 1995; <i>Mysteries, Marvels, Miracles: In the Lives of the Saints</i> in 1997; <i>Angels &amp; Devils</i> in 1999; and <i>Saints for the Sick</i> in 2010.&nbsp;</p><h2>Wacky Packages (Topps)</h2><p>Wacky Packages&#x2015;a series of collectible stickers featuring parodies of consumer products and well-known brands and packaging&#x2015;were first produced by the Topps company in 1967, then revived in 1973 for a highly successful run. In fact, for the first two years they were published, Wacky Packages were the only Topps product to achieve higher sales than their flagship line of baseball cards. The series has been relaunched several times over the years, most recently to great success in 2007. <br><br>Known affectionately among collectors as &#x201c;Wacky Packs,&#x201d; as a creative force with artist Art Spiegelman, the stickers were illustrated by such notable comics artists as Kim Deitch, , Bill Griffith, Jay Lynch, and Norm Saunders. <br><br>This first-ever collection of Series One through Series Seven (from 1973 and 1974) celebrates the 35th anniversary of Wacky Packages and is sure to amuse collectors and fans young and old.</p><p>The Topps Company, Inc., founded in 1938, is best known as a leading producer of baseball cards and other trading cards and stickers.

Charles Schulz told Borgman that it was "the worst name for a comic strip since <i>Peanuts</i>." It only stands to reason that the strip would go on to Peanuts-like notoriety. Today, it's impossible to imagine that the humorous, edgy strip could be known by any other name. <br>Complete with brilliant four-color illustrations, <i>Zits: Super-Sized</i> chronicles more than two years' worth of the wildly popular strip that's twice been honored with the award for Best Newspaper Comic Strip by the National Cartoonists Society.</p><p>Jim Borgman and his wife are the proud parents of five children.

When the hot dog is finished the vendor asks for three dollars. The yogi hands over a twenty and the vendor hands him the hot dog and pockets the bill. The yogi looks at him quizzically and says, &#34;Where is my change?&#34; The vendor grins and replies, &#34;Ah, but change comes from within.&#34; The book I read was Jack Schwarz&#39;s Voluntary Controls. It was the second in a series of books that laid the ground work for the holistic field of study. Since I was very young, alternative methods of achieving goals has been a pursuit of mine and this concept directly applies to the field of holistic research not by ignoring the methods currently in practice but by questioning how they work and asking if there might be a simpler, more effective way to reach solutions to problems. I am going to explain to you who Jack Schwarz was, what Voluntary Controls is about, and why you might benefit from reading it.</p><p></p><h2>Mr.Peabody&#39;s Apples</h2><p>"Mr. Peabody�s Apples takes place in 1949 in Happville, USA. Mr. Peabody is the beloved elementary school teacher and baseball coach, who one day finds himself ostracized when rumors spread through the small town. Mr. Peabody silences the gossip with an unforgettable and poignant lesson about how we must choose our words carefully to avoid causing harm to others. <p> Madonna dedicates Mr. Peabody's Apples to teachers everywhere."</p></p><p>With <i>Mr. Peabody's Apples</i>, her gorgeous sophomore venture into the realm of children's literature, Madonna sustains her transformation from material girl to mom. Inspired by a 300-year-old Ukrainian story and illustrated by the talented Loren Long, Madonna's tale is about the dangers of gossip. As a frequent target of the rumor mill, who better to teach the young ones about the "power of words" and their potential to cause "harm to others" than the newly reformed diva?<p> Set in a tiny American town, Madonna's story features the big-hearted and much beloved Mr. Peabody, an elementary school teacher and Little League coach who dedicates his summer Saturdays to the local losing team. The kindly teacher seems to savor life the way he savors his weekly apple--taking pleasure in the little things. One weekend after the game, Tommy Tittlebottom watches Mr. Peabody take his apple without paying for it. The following weekend Tommy calls in reinforcements to witness Mr. Peabody's transgression. By the next Saturday, Mr. Peabody's apparent theft has become grist for the Happville rumor mill and no one comes to Little League practice. These moments truly highlight Long's talents as an illustrator--the handsome Mr. Peabody (part Harry Connick Jr., part Robert Redford) comes to life on the page, his disappointment as palpable as that of Billy Little, the young boy who idolizes him. A simple explanation puts the rumors to rest, but as Mr. Peabody points out in a poignant demonstration, small talk can often lead to big trouble for everyone.</p><p> In a wonderful departure from her debut children's book <i>The English Roses</i>, Madonna has created a tribute to 1940's small-town America that delivers a fundamental message about respecting others. Children will love Mr. Peabody and parents will appreciate the gentle nudge with which he delivers his message. <i>Mr. Peabody's Apples</i> unfolds slowly, but readers young and old will want to linger over each illustrated page lovingly rendered in a muted pallet of rich color. <i>--Daphne Durham</i></p>Madonna is an international celebrity - pop star, film star and mother.

And then he made the mistake of freeing three slave children from their masters (who were suspiciously eager to part with them).

Her six brothers, her twin sister and her mother were the best family a girl could have...and yet, if they found out that she was back in town, they'd not only want to know why she'd walked out on her show halfway through its run, but they also wouldn't back off until they'd wrung every horrible detail out of her.<br><br>How did she know that?<br><br>Because that was exactly what she'd done to every one of them over the past twenty-five years whenever they'd faced a crisis-personal or otherwise.<br><br>So, instead of wheeling her suitcase from the San Francisco Airport baggage claim area over to the taxi station to head home to her apartment, she impulsively headed for the rental-car desk.<br><br>"Good morning, how can I help you?" chirped the blonde woman behind the desk.<br><br>Lori guessed the two of them had to be around the same age but, by contrast, she felt at least a decade wearier than her. "I need a car."<br><br>"Great! Where are you headed and how long do you need it for?"<br><br>The woman's smile was so bright, Lori felt her eyes tearing up from the glare. Fortunately, after her bleary-eyed flight across the country, immediately upon landing she'd put on her sunglasses to deal with the blinding sunlight pouring in through her small airplane window. She was glad she was still wearing them as she'd hate for the woman to think she was crying.<br><br>No, Lori refused to cry over anything that had happened in Chicago. Or during the year and a half before that.<br><br>She wasn't a crier, damn it. Never had been, never would be.<br><br>The world would have to do a heck of a lot more than give her a cheating scum of a boyfriend and take away her entire dancing career to make her cry.<br><br>She was young. She was healthy. She had her whole life ahead of her.<br><br>Somehow, some way, she'd figure out what to do with the next seventy years.<br><br>Which brought her back to the woman's questions. Where was she going? And for how long?<br><br>Blaming lack of sleep for the fact that all her brain could come up with was blanks, she asked, "Where's <em>your</em> favorite place to go?"<br><br>The woman was momentarily surprised by Lori's question, but then her face got all dreamy. "Pescadero."<br><br>Lori slipped her sunglasses down her nose so that she could peer at the woman over the frames. "Pescadero?"<br><br>Having lived in Northern California her entire life, Lori figured she must have driven through there at some point, but as far as she could recall, Pescadero had been nothing more than a bunch of farms strung together.<br><br>The woman nodded happily. "I just love the green rolling hills that seem to go on forever, all those sheep and cows munching away, and the fact that the ocean is at the end of nearly every farm road."<br><br>Lori loved living in the city. She loved working in cities, too, especially since her dance career had always been intrinsically tied to the movement all around her. A sleepy farm town was the last place she would ever have thought to choose for an impromptu vacation.<br><br>"It sounds perfect. How long can I have the car?"<br><br>Again, the woman gave her a slightly strange look before saying, "One month. Longer than that and I'll have to fill out additional paperwork. But it's really more of a day trip. A shortish one, at that. I can't imagine how you could possibly spend a month in Pescadero."<br><br>Even though Lori was silently wondering the same thing, she handed over her credit card and signed a dozen forms promising that she wouldn't damage the car. A few minutes later, she was holding the keys and was about to walk away from the rental desk when she turned back.<br><br>"Any idea how to get to Pescadero from here?"<br><br>An hour and a half later, Lori was wondering if the farmland was ever going to end when she saw a roof. Feeling like a sailor who had been out to sea for months before finally catching sight of land, she put her foot down harder on the gas pedal and sped toward what she could now see was the teeny-tiny Pescadero Main Street.<br><br>The car rental lady had been right about the pretty green fields and the cute sheep, but she'd somehow forgotten to mention how quiet the silence was...or how lonesome.<br><br>Lori had filled her world with loud music and tall buildings and vibrant people for so long that it was strange to be surrounded by complete quiet. She'd flipped on the car radio at one point, but it had felt akin to turning on a boom box in the middle of a church, so she'd immediately turned it off.<br><br>Still, for all that her mood wasn't exactly at its best, it was the first sunny day she'd seen in weeks and she was determined to enjoy the warm sun and blue skies. Plus, just as her auto-mechanic-slash-mogul brother Zach had always claimed, there really was something about getting in a car and going for a drive. Granted, she thought as she looked down at her little rental car, he usually did his joyrides in a Ferrari. Besides, he didn't do them alone anymore, now that he and Heather were in love and engaged.<br><br>Lori pulled up in front of the Pescadero General Store just as a little girl walked outside carrying a big bag of dog food and wearing a huge smile. A man Lori easily assumed was her grandfather was barely a beat behind her holding a brand-new dog crate. Wearing cowboy boots and well-worn blue jeans, they both fit perfectly into the farm town.<br><br>As she got out of the car, Lori saw the girl's puppy. His leash had been tied to a nearby post and when he caught sight of the little girl, the black-and-white dog started wagging its tail so hard its whole body looked like a kite flying in the breeze. The girl immediately dropped the bag of dog food on the ground and picked up the puppy in her arms to give it kisses. The grizzled old farmer said in a gruff voice, "You're going to spoil him," but his eyes were full of love.<br><br>For the second time today, Lori felt her eyes begin to tear up. She'd gotten used to the bright sunlight and had flipped her sunglasses up on top of her head a while ago, but now she plopped them back over her eyes.<br><br>As she stepped onto the sidewalk, both the man and the girl stopped to look at her, each of them doing a double take. She couldn't figure out what had shocked them so much...not until she finally looked down at herself.<br><br>Oh, yeah, this was why. The formfitting, sleeveless, bright-pink top covered in multicolored sequins that ended at midthigh, and nearly opaque tights combined with the glittery heels she'd been dancing in, were a little strange to be wearing in the middle of the day. Not just here, but anywhere, really.<br><br>She'd completely forgotten what she was wearing when she'd stormed out of the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago, thrown her things into her suitcase, then headed to the airport to catch the next plane to San Francisco. She'd wrapped an oversize scarf around herself on the plane and in the airport, but it was so warm and sunny during her drive that she'd stripped it off and had left it on the passenger seat.<br><br>Of course the puppy didn't care what she was wearing, and when she reached for it, he wriggled his furry body toward her. "What a cute puppy," she said to the little girl. "What's his name?"<br><br>"Jonas."<br><br>"That's a great name," Lori said as she smiled and patted the dog, but just as her fingertips stroked the soft fur between the puppy's ears, the girl's grandfather dragged them away.<br><br>A moment later, when Lori turned to head for the General Store's front door, the ground felt as though it was moving beneath her. Bracing herself against the wall, Lori realized she hadn't had anything to eat for nearly twenty-four hours. Despite what most people thought dancers' lives were like, she had a healthy appetite and a fast metabolism, and knew she shouldn't have gone so long without eating.<br><br>It was just that food hadn't sounded very good for a while now....<br><br>With renewed purpose, she pushed through the door. Animal feed and farm supplies ran the length of one side of the store. In the middle was a display of knitwear, jeans, cowboy boots and what looked like packages of underwear and socks. The other side of the store had a deli counter, several refrigerated units holding eggs and cheese and milk, plus shelves weighed down with canned food.<br><br>She grabbed a bag of chips and walked up to the register. The teenage boy behind the deli counter turned bright red. "Wh-what can I get y-" he swallowed hard and reached up to loosen the neck of his T-shirt "-you."<br><br>Even as it occurred to her that maybe she should have gone back to the car for her scarf to wrap around her dance outfit, she enjoyed the appreciation in his eyes. Just because she was done with men didn't mean she didn't still want to be <em>wanted</em> by them. That way she could have the pleasure of kicking them all to the curb-except for sweet teenage boys, of course.<br><br>"What's the best sandwich you've got?"<br><br>His eyes went wide at her question, as if she'd asked him for the answer to how the earth rotated on its axis rather than just about cold cuts and bread. And boy, was he working hard to keep his eyes on her face rather than letting them drop to her breasts, which were pretty much on full display in her outfit. He was so cute that she wanted to leap across the counter to hug him for making her feel pretty again, at least for a few seconds of adolescent adoration.<br><br>"Um, I don't know." He swallowed hard again before turning to scan the list of sandwiches handwritten on the board behind him. "Maybe the Muffuletta?"<br><br>"Sounds good." She put down the chips on the counter as he started to ring her up. "I'll also take the strongest cup of coffee you can brew."<br><br>Who knew how much longer she'd be out driving these farm roads before she found a place to stay for the night? She did have the rental car for an entire month, after all.<br><br>He took her money with a shaking hand and when she asked, "Could you tell me where the bathroom is?" he dropped it all on the floor, then hit his head on the open register drawer when he went to pick it up.<br><br>Clearly not trusting himself to speak this time, he simply knelt on the floor and pointed toward the back of the building with a shaky hand. Lori figured it was a good idea to give him a break while he made her sandwich; she'd hate for him to slice off the tip of a finger with the meat cutter just because she was standing too close in barely there spandex and glitter.<br><br>After quickly taking care of business, she looked at herself in the mirror and would have laughed if she hadn't been so horrified by the mess she found in the reflection. With quick and efficient professionalism she fixed her hair and makeup. She'd always subscribed to the idea that if you looked good, you felt good, but today she had a feeling mascara and lip gloss weren't going to fix much of anything.<br><br>After leaving the bathroom, she took a few moments to look around a little bit. On second glance, the General Store was pretty cute inside, a little farm "superstore" with groceries and clothes and chicken feed, clearly all of equal importance to the people who lived here. One table had a Local Authors sign on it and she stopped to scan the books of poetry, novels and a couple of non-fiction tomes on farming techniques. The books gave her a sense of the community that this store supported, likely made up of farmers and their families who had been here for generations.<br><br>She'd been part of the dancing community for so long she hadn't ever looked for any other world to belong to. Especially not when Sullivan family events with her mother and seven siblings were frequent enough to take up any free time she had.<br><br>But now, even the thought of dancing made her sick to her stomach. Her ex had wooed her with dancing. and then betrayed her with it. Once upon a time, she'd danced for herself, for the pure joy it had given her. Until these past few months, when she'd been little more than Victor's puppet, dancing to try to please him. By the time she realized that nothing pleased him, she'd forgotten how to dance for any other reason. And now, it felt as if there was a dead, numb zone inside her where her heart used to be.<br><br>She supposed she'd find another community to belong to in time.<br><br>Lori was just about to head back to the deli counter to pick up her sandwich when she noticed a large board filled with flyers. She'd always been interested in strangers' lives and devoured biographies as fast as her librarian sister, Sophie, could give them to her. Looking at a community posting board was such a perfect window into lives she'd never live. And the truth was that as she'd driven the short Main Street, she'd been surprised by how cute the town was. The storefronts dripped with old Western charm and she'd even passed a farm stand that looked like a picture out of a magazine.<br><br>In the middle of the board was a piece of white paper with the words <em>Farmhand Needed</em> in a strong, clearly masculine hand. Not for one second of her life had she ever thought about living or working on a farm. For her entire life, she'd known exactly what she was and what she would be: a dancer.<br><br>Only, since she wasn't going to dance anymore, why not try something completely different, something that could very well turn out to be her second calling?<br><br>Maybe if she had gotten more than a dozen hours of sleep all week, she might have taken a clearer, more coolheaded look at the decision she was making.<br><br>Because she wasn't looking for trouble. She swore she wasn't.<br><br>The thing was, for the first time in a very long time, Lori felt a stirring of excitement. Of anticipation.<br><br>And a thrill that felt a little bit like fear.<br><br>She'd always liked the scary rides at the amusement park, and had been the one to drag her siblings to horror movies. But what could possibly be scary about working as a farmhand?<br><br>Especially when she'd already decided she was going to be the best damn farmhand the world had ever seen. Not to try to please anyone else, but to please <em>herself,</em> and to know that at the end of a long day on the farm, she'd done good work that she could be proud of.<br><br>Lori ripped the ad off the board and put it down in front of the deli boy. She was impulsive, but she wasn't stupid, so she asked him, "Do you know the guy who posted this? Is he a nice man?"<br><br>The boy nodded. "Sure, Grayson is nice."<br><br>Lori liked the sound of that name. <em>Grayson.</em> Probably some old farmer like the grandfather she'd seen on the sidewalk-someone who'd been married for fifty years and needed extra help with his chickens and cows. She had no idea what that help would entail, but she'd always been a fast learner.<br><br>She grinned and asked, "Can you tell me how to get to his farm?"<br><br></p><h2>Lana: The Lady, the Legend, the Truth</h2><p>She was the Sweater Girl, provocatively sexy but with a small-town winsomeness - a combination that meant dynamite at the box office.

In his essay "All Things Censored," he describes how NPR commissioned him to write a poem, then refused to air the work because of its political content: a defense of Mumia Abu-Jamal, the African-American journalist on death row. In "The Poetics of Commerce," Espada takes on the Nike corporation, which solicited a poem for use in a television commercial as part of the company's ongoing propaganda campaign to divert attention from its dismal human rights record in Asian sweatshops.</p><p>Espada stirs together ingredients of memoir and reclaimed history in "Postcard from the Empire of Queen Ixolib," which recalls his pilgrimage to the town in Mississippi where his father was jailed half a century ago for not moving to the back of the bus.

In all, over forty plays are included. Each work has been fully annotated and is prefaced by a substantial introduction. In many cases the language is to some extent modernized in order to make the plays more accessible to readers today. </p></p><p><b>Christina M.

It sniffs about.</i>&#x2014;Jean-Didier, biologist<br><br>How vividly I remember the first moments of my vocation as a clown! I was seventeen at the time, and spending a rather dreary month in an <i>all-inclusive</i> resort in Turkey&#x2014;it was, incidentally, the last time I was to go on holiday with my parents. My silly bitch of a sister&#x2014;she was thirteen at the time&#x2014;was just beginning to turn the guys on. It was at breakfast; as usual in the morning, a line had formed in front of the scrambled eggs, something the vacationers seemed incredibly fond of. Next to me, an old Englishwoman (desiccated, nasty, the kind who would cut up foxes to decorate her living room), who had already helped herself copiously to eggs, didn't hesitate to snaffle up the last three sausages on the hot plate. It was five to eleven, the breakfast service had come to an end, it was inconceivable that the waiter would bring out any more sausages. The German who was in the line behind her became rigid; his fork, already reaching for a sausage, stopped in midair, and his face turned red with indignation. He was an enormous German, a colossus, more than two meters tall and weighing at least one hundred and fifty kilos. I thought for a moment that he was going to plant his fork in the octogenarian's eyes, or grab her by the neck and smash her head onto the hot plates. She, with that senile, unconscious selfishness of old people, came trotting back to her table as if nothing had happened. The German was angry, I could sense that he was incredibly angry, but little by little his face grew calm, and he went off sadly, sausageless, in the direction of his compatriots.<br><br>Out of this incident I composed a little sketch about a bloody revolt in a holiday resort, sparked by the tiny details that contradicted the <i>all-inclusive</i> formula: a shortage of sausages at breakfast, followed by a supplemental charge for the mini-golf. That evening, I performed this sketch at the "You Have Talent!" soir�e (one evening every week the show was made up of turns done by the vacationers, instead of by professionals); I played all the characters, thus taking my first steps down the road of the one-man show, a road I scarcely left throughout my career. Nearly everyone came to the after-dinner show, as there was fuck-all to do until the discotheque opened; that meant an audience of eight hundred people. My sketch was a resounding success, people cried with laughter, and there was noisy applause. That very evening, at the discotheque, a pretty brunette called Sylvie told me I had made her laugh a lot, and that she liked boys with a sense of humor. Dear Sylvie. And so, in this way, my virginity was lost and my vocation decided.<br><br>After my baccalaureate, I signed up for acting lessons; there followed some inglorious years, during which I grew nastier and nastier and, as a consequence, more and more caustic; thanks to this, success finally arrived&#x2014;on a scale that surprised me. I had begun with small sketches on reunited immigrant families, journalists for <i>Le Monde,</i> and the mediocrity of the middle classes in general&#x2014;I successfully captured the incestuous temptations of midcareer intellectuals aroused by their daughters or daughters-in-law, with their bare belly buttons and thongs showing above their pants. In short, I was a <i>cutting observer of contemporary reality;</i> I was often compared to Pierre Desproges. While continuing to devote myself to the one-man show, I occasionally accepted invitations to appear on television programs, which I chose for their big audiences and general mediocrity. I never forgot to emphasize this mediocrity, albeit subtly: the presenter had to feel a little endangered, but not too much. All in all, I was a good professional; I was just a bit overrated. I was not the only one.<br><br>I don't mean that my sketches were unfunny; they <i>were</i> funny. I was, indeed, a <i>cutting observer of contemporary reality;</i> it was just that everything now seemed so elementary to me, it seemed that so few things remained that could be observed in contemporary reality: we had simplified and pruned so much, broken so many barriers, taboos, misplaced hopes, and false aspirations; truly, there was so little left. On the social level, there were the rich and the poor, with a few fragile links between them&#x2014;the <i>social ladder,</i> a subject on which it was the done thing to joke; and the more serious possibility of being ruined. On the sexual level there were those who aroused desire, and those who did not: a tiny mechanism, with a few complications of modality (homosexuality, etc.) that could nevertheless be easily summarized as vanity and narcissistic competition, which had already been well described by the French moralists three centuries before. There were also, of course, the <i>honest folk,</i> those who work, who ensure the effective production of wealth, also those who make sacrifices for their children&#x2014;in a manner that is rather comic or, if you like, pathetic (but I was, above all, a comedian); those who have neither beauty in their youth, nor ambition later, nor riches ever; but who hold on wholeheartedly, and more sincerely than anyone, to the values of beauty, youth, wealth, ambition, and sex; those who, in some kind of way, <i>make the sauce bind.</i> Those people, I am afraid to say, could not constitute a <i>subject.</i> I did, however, include a few of them in my sketches to give diversity, and the <i>reality effect;</i> but I began all the same to get seriously tired. What's worse is that I was considered to be a <i> humanist;</i> a pretty abrasive humanist, but a humanist all the same. To give some context, here is one of the jokes that peppered my shows:<br><br> "Do you know what they call the fat stuff around the vagina?"<br><br> "No."<br><br> "The woman."<br><br>Strangely, I managed to throw in that kind of thing, while still getting good reviews in <i>Elle</i> and <i>T</i>�<i>l</i>�<i>rama;</i> it's true that the arrival of the Arab immigrant comedians had validated macho excesses once more, and that I was genuinely excessive, albeit with grace: going close to the bone, repeatedly, but always staying in control. Finally, the benefit of the humorist's trade, or more generally of a <i>humorous attitude</i> in life, is to be able to behave like a complete bastard with impunity, and even to profit hugely from your depravity, in terms of sexual conquests and money, all with general approval.<br><br>My supposed humanism was, in reality, built on very thin foundations: a vague outburst against tobacconists, an allusion to the corpses of negro clandestines cast up on the Spanish coasts, had been enough to give me a reputation as a <i>lefty</i> and a <i>defender of human rights.</i> Me, a lefty? I had occasionally been able to introduce a few, vaguely young, antiglobalization campaigners into my sketches, without giving them an immediately antipathetic role; I had occasionally indulged in a certain demagogy: I was, I repeat, a good professional. Besides, I looked like an Arab, which helps; the only residual ideological content of the left, in those days, was antiracism, or more precisely antiwhite racism. I did not in fact know the origins of these Arab features, which became more pronounced as the years went by: my mother was of Spanish origin and my father, as far as I know, was Breton. For example, my sister, that little bitch, was certainly the Mediterranean type, but she wasn't half as dark as me, and her hair was straight. One had to wonder: had my mother always been scrupulously faithful? Or had I been engendered by some Mustapha? Or even&#x2014;another hypothesis&#x2014;by a Jew? Fuck that: Arabs came to my shows in droves&#x2014;Jews also, by the way, although in smaller numbers; and all these people paid for their tickets, at the full price.

Women in general lack a sense of humor, which is why they consider humor to be one of the virile qualities; throughout my career, opportunities for placing my organ in one of the appropriate orifices were never lacking. To tell the truth, such intercourse was never up to much: women who are interested in comedians are getting old, nearly forty, and are beginning to suspect that things are going to turn bad. Some of them had fat asses, others breasts like flannels, sometimes both. In other words, there was nothing arousing about them; and, anyway, when it's more and more difficult to get a hard-on, the interest goes. They weren't all that old, either; I knew that as they approached fifty they would once again long for something reassuring, easy, and false&#x2014;and of course they wouldn't find it. In the meantime, I could only confirm to them&#x2014;completely unintentionally, believe me, it's never a pleasure&#x2014;the decline of their erotic value; I could only confirm their first suspicions, and instill in them, despite myself, a despairing view of life: no, it was not maturity that awaited them, but simply old age; there was not a new blossoming at the end of the road, but a bundle of frustrations and sufferings, at first insignificant, then very quickly unbearable; it wasn't very healthy, all that, not very healthy at all. Life begins at fifty, that's true; inasmuch as it ends at forty.<br>Daniel 24, 1<br><br>Look at the little creatures moving in the distance; look.

Vancouver in the clean, crisp summer of 1945 was full of wonder to this prospector's son from a remote village on the Arctic coast of Alaska. The reason for this happy visit was the end of the war in Europe and the return of his father by troopship that day.<br><br>Amid whirling bunting and the cheering of proud relatives, the veterans clambered off the Canadian Pacific steam train, some to renew their previous lives and loves, many to face the bitter realization of unattainable dreams or unexpected betrayals.<br><br>Daniel did not notice that his father was thin and gaunt, for he was still a great bear of a man and he bore gift-wrapped parcels of exciting shapes.<br><br>A taxicab took the family to their cheap lodgings close to Lion's Gate bridge. After tea and once the first waves of excitement were spent, Father made his long-planned pronouncement.<br><br>"We have six days before the steamer takes us home, my hidjies." Nobody knew why he called them that-only that it had a good, warm meaning. "And we will never forget these days, because the Hun are smashed forever and we are together."<br><br>The deep, flaky bilberry pie did the rounds again and everyone slept well despite their excitement, all six to the single bedroom.<br><br>The days flickered by in a kaleidoscope of happiness. They watched folk skiing on the lower slopes of Mount Grouse, on long planks of wood that looked impossible to control. Many skiers came to grief and Dan and his family laughed till the tears came.<br><br>They took a horse and cab to the wharves, bought toffee apples and walked hand in hand to watch the tradesmen at the sugar factory, and the trawlers with their brawny crews. Thousands more soldiers and sailors returned on giant troopships and the family joined the welcoming crowds. They saw the zoo and a pantomime, gazed at the sleaze of Gas Town and sang with gusto on the Sunday, for Mother and Father were keen Presbyterians, he with his Dutch Reform Church upbringing and she with a background of Wyoming and pioneer stock.<br><br>The Sunday before they were to take the steamer north, Father sprang his big surprise . . . There was a traveling circus in town and, dammit, they would check it out that very night.<br><br>Before the great event they squeezed into a packed church and joined in the songs of praise and the prayers of thanksgiving of the Vancouver people for the deliverance of their loved ones.<br><br>Then to the circus.<br><br>Clowns, elephants that could count, a giraffe, bears in kilts, dwarves, a sasquatch monster from the forests of the Rocky Mountain Trench, black fuzzy men, balloon shoots for prizes, and coconuts from the South Pacific propped on posts.<br><br>Even at five, brought up among Eskimo children, Daniel could throw the wooden ball straight and true. And he could shoot a light gun with fair accuracy providing he could take his time. He glowed with pride at his armful of coconuts and wooden teddies.<br><br>They cried with delight inside the sparkling waterways of the Canal of Love; they oohed and aahed with delicious horror in the House of Screams as ghouls of sacking and animal bones swished by on unseen pulleys.<br><br>Everyone but seven-year-old Naomi, who hated heights, was awed when Father pointed to the monstrous Roller-Wheel with its eighteen swinging gondolas. Daniel sat on his narrow seat, filled with curiosity and sticky-lipped with candy floss. An Indian and a grinning Chinaman, both in top hats, checked that the family were all strapped in. Because he was so little he was jammed in beside eleven-year-old Ruth, his eldest sister. In front of him sat Naomi, his mother's hands clenched about her and, at the prow of the gaily painted craft, just behind the carved redskin figurehead with its fearsome features, sat their father, beaming with pride and forever glancing over his shoulder to check that his brood were "having the finest time of their lives," especially his dear wife, to whom he had sworn that very morning, as he held her close, that he would never, never leave her again . . . not for the Commonwealth nor yet for the King himself.<br><br>As other families took their seats, the great twinkling wheel rotated in fits and starts until all the gondolas were filled with laughing, or gaping, passengers.<br><br>Then a whistle blew, the Chinaman waved a flag and two gates of steel clanged shut below them. Daniel smelled hot oil and roasted chestnuts. The cool air lifted Naomi's golden hair. Dad shouted, "Hold on, my love. Hold tight, my little darlings . . . try to kiss the stars."<br><br>The wheel spun ever faster and Daniel loved the speed, the height, the newness of it all. Only when Naomi screamed did the intense wonder that he felt begin to fade. And as his other sisters started to moan, even big Ruth, he knew that he too should be sensing fear. But he felt only more aware, more able to observe and consider. The giddy, lurching passage of the gondola was not as before. Something had changed. They were out of kilter with the mother wheel. He saw sparks in growing streams and a broken spar. Their cockleshell had come away from its housing on one side and as they swung over the top of the great arc and began the downward rush, so the remaining hinge-spar split and they were free, cartwheeling through space.<br><br>Nobody heard their screaming as they fell, for the carousels and the brass bands, the loudspeakers and sideshow criers produced a cacophony of sound that would have drowned out the knell of doom. And nobody saw the lace bonnet of young Anna, who clung by herself to the rearmost seat, glide and dip away like a falling kite.<br><br>The gondola crashed through the canvas of a small marquee. Ruth's body and the whim of chance saved Daniel's life. He was thrown against a pile of clothing. The wind was knocked out of him and his legs were broken but he remained fully conscious.<br><br>He saw the wrecked and green-painted prow, the head of a warrior, deeply impaled in the bowels of a fat Gypsy lady. He saw that his mother and Naomi had landed, tightly embracing, on the Gypsy's table. Their heads had come together with such force that the gray hair and the golden hair seemed to sprout from a single pulp. They were mercifully still but for their stockinged legs, which jerked in time with the billowing canvas of the ruined tent. Of sister Anna he could see no trace: perhaps an angel had caught her in the air and she was saved, as he was. He could feel no pain, only a desperate need to gulp for more air.<br><br>He thought he heard his name whispered aloud. Father was staring down at him, attached by one arm to the shattered upper end of the main tent pole. But now he was foreshortened, like the circus dwarves, for his torso had been severed at the waist. Daniel could see this all so clearly, for his father's remains were close above him and the mouth, agape beneath the thick moustache, did indeed seem to pout with the shape of Daniel's name.<br><br>From that moment until the present day, whenever de Villiers felt the images of that night hover at the fringes of his mind, he clenched his fists and forced them away.<br><br>With the passage of years, the warmer human emotions, with which he had been genetically blessed, remained in place on the far side of his self-imposed shutter. By excluding his sensitivities, de Villiers had retained his sanity. He was, but for his chosen profession as a contract killer, a pleasant enough human being . . .<br><br>2<br><br>Dhofar is the southern province of Oman, sharing desert borders with Saudi Arabia and South Yemen. In the 1960s a band of Dhofari nationalists, aiming to rid their country of an oppressive Omani sultan, visited the USSR in search of support. Their nationalist and Muslim aspirations were soon redirected by the Soviets into a new guerrilla unit called the Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman (PFLO). The unit's Marxist fighters, operating on their own home ground, were frighteningly efficient and for a while invincible. Fortunately, in 1970, Qaboos bin Said exiled his reactionary father, became the new sultan and proclaimed an amnesty. Many terrorists responded and were formed into armed firqat groups to fight against their former comrades, often from the same tribe or family.<br><br>Amr bin Issa, Sheikh of the Bait Jarboat tribe in Dhofar, was not a happy man. At forty-seven he was envied by many of his fellow jebalis, mountain tribesmen, for he was rich-richer than most jebalis could imagine.<br><br>As a seventeen-year-old Amr had left home with an uncle and sailed the Gulf waters in sardine dhows. For a while he worked as a gardener in Bahrain and as a delivery courier around town using a Lambretta moped. He had a keen eye for business and took advantage of the newfound wealth of the United Arab Emirates to set up a grocery and hardware shop in Dubai. A retail chain of Woolworth's lookalikes then evolved, second only to Khimji Ramdas in size and profitability.<br><br>Amr had married young, for he had a strong sexual appetite. His first wife was a great disappointment to him. She was an orphan girl who, like the majority of Dhofari women, had been brutally circumcised soon after birth. Her clitoris had been removed and, with it, most of her sensuality. Two sons were born who remained with their mother when Amr divorced her and went abroad. She remarried a man from the Bait Antaash and Amr rarely saw the two boys. Nonetheless they remained the blood of his blood.<br><br>His second marriage was altogether different. At the age of twenty- four he stopped off at an island on a fishing voyage and fell in love with a fourteen-year-old Shahra girl, Shamsa. Even before he discovered that her sexuality was intact he had determined to marry her, for to him she seemed the most alluring creature on earth.<br><br>The Shahra ranked low in the strict tribal hierarchy of Dhofar. Once the most powerful tribe in the land, they had borne the brunt of a century's fighting against Portuguese invaders. Greatly weakened, the Shahra gradually became subjugated to the Qara tribes until they were "nontribe," losing the right to carry weapons and working only as serfs to the Qara in return for security. Shahra men could not take wives from the master tribes although the women, lighter-skinned than most Dhofaris, were available to all as brides at especially low prices.<br><br>Out of a powerful sexual bond grew a friendship and trust that was rare in Dhofari marriages. Shamsa bore Amr four sons over the next seven years. Amr was a proud husband and father, a successful businessman and popular within the Bait Jarboat tribe when, in 1970, their sheikh died without a hereditary successor. The dead leader had spent much of his life avenging the tribe's honor following a series of raids which had decimated and impoverished them in the 1940s. There was great contention among the Bait Jarboat about who should succeed him. Those of the tribe associated with the hard-core communists of the PFLO had their champion, while the nonatheistic majority favored Amr, whose great wealth, personal wisdom and family connections were held in high esteem. Amr won and became sheikh.<br><br>Like most of his countrymen, from sheikh to humble wood collector, Amr and his sons fought with the PFLO for the freedom of Dhofar. One of his sons was killed in 1969, a second in 1972 and yet another in January 1975, all at the hands of the government forces. In accordance with the tribal tradition of thaa'r, or revenge, it was Amr's duty to avenge himself for the killing of his sons.<br><br>For three years, with the war at its height, the newly appointed Sheikh Amr did his best for the tribe, leaving his business concerns to his managers in the Gulf. In Dubai he was an extremely wealthy man, but on the jebel he lived much the same sort of life as other jebalis.<br><br>In 1974 Shamsa had conceived unexpectedly and, following a fall while she was driving their goats over the hill pastures, had died in childbirth. Amr was stunned. His tribal duties lost their importance to him. His popularity slowly waned and the machinations of his opponents stirred accordingly. A cousin named Hamoud, envious of Amr's position, used Amr's failure to fulfill the thaa'r and avenge the deaths of his three sons as fuel to rouse tribal sentiments against him.<br><br>Fundamentalist Islamic law embraces various rules, or sharia, but by far the most binding for a Dhofari are those of thaa'r. The aggrieved relative is expected by law to insist on an eye for an eye. In return for murder, execution. For manslaughter, blood money. No time limit is set on the deed of vengeance. It can take place forty years on, but the executor must show his intention clearly and act as circumstances allow.<br><br>There are many different applications of the thaa'r even within a single Islamic country, because the dictates of the Koran simply reflect, in a modified form, the principles of pre-Islamic tribal behavior. If among the elders of a tribe there is dissension as to how the hadiyth, the Prophet's sayings, should be applied, then a consensus of opinion, ijma', can produce any solution. Over the years the differences in the severity with which Koranic punishments are applied in different lands have increased greatly. Sunni, Shi'ite and, in Oman, Ibadi Muslims apply further differences as a result of their own considerable divergences within the body of Islam.<br><br>Sudan is a Muslim country but the thaa'r there has become all but nonexistent. In 1988 five Palestinian terrorists murdered two Sudanese and five British peace workers in a Khartoum hotel. They were arrested and the Sudanese government contacted the parents of the dead Britons through the Foreign Office. A middle-aged suburban couple in Britain were suddenly faced with the choice of whether they wished their child's murderers to be executed, fined or pardoned. They were unable to make up their minds, and all five terrorists were released from jail in January 1991. In Dhofar Sultan Qaboos has had enormous success in subduing the thaa'r, to the extent that there were more tit-for-tat killings in Northern Ireland in 1990 than there were thaa'r murders in Dhofar. But the hard-core believers merely bide their time.<br><br>In July 1990 a jebali civil servant, a long-since pardoned member of the PFLO, was commuting to his air-conditioned office in Salalah in his air-conditioned Mercedes. He stopped at a zebra crossing to allow a pedestrian to pass. Over the past twelve years the two men had often passed each other in the street. That morning something snapped in the mind of the civil servant and he rammed the pedestrian against a wall, seriously injuring him. He was sent to jail, having readily admitted his intention to kill the man, who had murdered his brother back in 1973.</p><h2>The Serpent of Paradise: The Incredible Story of How Satan&#39;s Rebellion Serves God&#39;s Purposes</h2><p>How we perceive our enemy will largely determine how we fight against him. Unless we grasp how the devil fits into God's scheme of things, we will find it difficult to stand against his conspiracy against us personally and his influence within our culture. We can have a proper theology of the devil only if we have a proper theology of God. Only when we stand in awe of God will we find it unnecessary to be in awe of Satan. As Martin Luther once said, 'The devil is God's devil.' God is still in control.<br><br><i>The Serpent of Paradise</i> gives an overview of the career of Satan and his interaction with the Almighty. It traces his fall from an exalted position to his demise in everlasting shame and contempt. It shows us that Satan always loses even when 'he wins.' Best of all, it confirms that we who have been translated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light are able to stand against him. Be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.

There's no one better than Block--steeped in genre tradition, yet as in touch with today as can be--to show the two can work together." -Gerald So, My Life Called So <br><br>"A foray into the psyche of sex-obsessed men written with Block's trademark pinpoint psychological accuracy and lively dialogue. &nbsp;Noir enthusiasts and people needing a master class on how to write sex scenes are going to love this novel. We live in oddly puritanical times, and a book like THE GIRL WITH THE DEEP BLUE EYES is going make things interesting this fall." -Benoit Lelievre, Dead End Follies<br><br>"MWA Grand Master Block adds a generous dollop of eroticism to this ingeniously plotted study in criminality and corruption. Noir fans will be pleased that the book contains not a single likable character." &nbsp;-Publishers Weekly <br>"A gleeful exercise in over the top noir. Aggressively politically incorrect but seriously addictive. Torrid encounters, treachery, twists piled upon each other and a particularly cynical view of the world and its denizens make this a guilty pleasure if you leave any moral judgment at home. Sin and crime have never been so attractive." -Maxim Jakubowski<br><br>"Block's writing is as crisp as ever and there's a lot of sex in this book. Not only does The Girl with the Deep Blue Eyes read like a sexualized modernization of Double Indemnity or The Postman Always Rings Twice, the character of Doak adds some additional wrinkles I won't give away here. As more is revealed of Doak's true nature, you have to wonder if anyone will make it out alive." -Daniel Schwent, Dangerous Dan's Book Blog<br><br>"He's one of the greatest living crime writers, a bearded New Yorker with the head of an old faun. Lawrence Block is the creator of Matt Scudder....Lately, the novelist returned to his roots: pulp fiction. The result is The Girl with the Deep Blue Eyes, a spicy, cynical, manipulative, bleak crime novel, full of ribald eroticism, and we don't know yet if there will be a French translation. An American TV producer is going to make a show out of it. Let's hope TV will succeed where cinema has failed." -Sandra Benedetti, L'Express</p><h2>The Madness of Adam and Eve: How Schizophrenia Shaped Humanity</h2><p>This volume presents an argument which aims to fundamentally alter our view of the roots of humanity and answer questions of how a species of clever ape evolved into something different. Schizophrenia is the only illness to be found in equal measure in all racial groups, pointing to the fact that the disease must have been present at the dawn of mankind before the races diversified and spread from Africa throughout Eurasia and Australasia. The book aims to reveal how the genetic legacy of schizophrenia is at the heart of the best and worst of human achievement.</p><p>This radical, highly readable and absorbing narrative leads to a new understanding of human evolution. <p>100,000 years ago we became human, and technical, religious, artistic, military and criminal abilities emerged. The first modern humans migrated from Africa to Eurasia and Australasia, carrying with them the genetic basis of schizophrenia, the only major illness found to the same extent in all racial groups. Modern evidence shows that families where schizophrenia is present are also exceptionaly creative in many different fields. Albert Einstein and James Joyce each had a schizophrenic child. David Horrobin draws on his knowledge of evolution, medicine and psychiatry to generate a startling hypothesis: we are human because some of us are schizophrenic and because a "touch of schizophrenia" is associated with that creativity which defines us and separates us from our nearest primate relatives.</p>David Horrobin was a scholar of Balliol College, Oxford, where he obtained the top First Class Honours medical degree of his year. To this he added a clinical medical degree and a doctorate in neuroscience. He has founded two biotech companies. Laxdale, the company he currently runs, specializes in developing new drugs for psychiatric and neurological disorders. He is the founding editor of Medical Hypothesis, which for almost thirty years has been the leading journal for the presentation of new ideas in medicine. He is the author of over 500 scientific papers.

Paul Wilson, the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Repairman Jack novels, lives in Wall, NJ.<p><strong>I</strong>.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay!&#x201d; Alicia shouted as the cab jerked to the left to swing around a NYNEX truck plodding up Madison Avenue. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not in a rush!&#x201d;<br>The driver-curly dark hair, a Saddam Hussein mustache, and swarthy skin--didn&#x2019;t seem to hear. He jogged his machine two lanes left, then three lanes right, hitting the brakes and gunning the engine, hitting and gunning, jerking Alicia back and forth, left and right in the rear seat, then swerving to avoid another yellow maniacmobile trying a similar move through the morning traffic.<br>Her cab&#x2019;s net gain: one car length. Maybe.<br>Alicia rapped on the smudged, scratched surface of the plastic divider. &#x201c;Slow down, dammit! I want to arrive in one piece.&#x201d;<br>But the driver ignored her. If anything, he upped his speed. He seemed to be engaged in a private war against every other car in Manhattan. And God help you if you were a pedestrian.<br>Alicia should have been used to this. She&#x2019;d grown up in Manhattan. She hadn&#x2019;t been here for a while, though. She&#x2019;d moved away at eighteen for college and had stayed away for medical school and her residencies in pediatrics and infectious diseases. She hadn&#x2019;t wanted to come back--what with that man and her half brother Thomas still living here--but St. Vincent&#x2019;s had made her the proverbial offer she couldn&#x2019;t refuse.<br>So now, after a little over a year, she was still getting used to the city&#x2019;s changes. Who&#x2019;d have believed they&#x2019;d be able to scour off the grim sleaziness that she&#x2019;d assumed to be permanently etched on Times Square?<br>Cabbies too. What had happened to them? They&#x2019;d always been pushy, brazen drivers--you had to be to get around in this city--but this new crop were maniacs.<br>Finally they hit the Forties.<br>Almost there, Alicia thought. Maybe I&#x2019;ll live to see another sunset after all.<br>But as they neared Forty-eighth she noticed her cab was still in the center lane, accelerating. At first she thought he was going to miss her turn off, then she saw the opening: two lanes to the right, behind a graffiti-coated delivery truck and just ahead of a bus pulling away from the curb.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not!&#x201d; Alicia cried. &#x201c;Please tell me you&#x2019;re not going to try to--&#x201d;<br>He did. And he made it--just barely--but not without forcing the bus to slam on its brakes and give him a deafening blast from its horn.<br>The cabbie floored it along the open stretch of Forty-eighth, then swerved violently rightward toward the curb. The cab jerked to a halt at the address Alicia had given him when she&#x2019;d slid into its rear seat down in Greenwich Village.<br>&#x201c;Six-seventy-five,&#x201c; he said.<br>Alicia sat there fuming, wishing she were strong enough to break through the partition and throttle him. She wasn&#x2019;t. But she could give him a taste of his own medicine--in reverse.<br>Slowly, she inched toward the curbside door, opened it with the greatest of care, and edged herself out. Then she took out her wallet and began to count her change...carefully. She had about two dollars&#x2019; worth. She picked out a dollar-seventy-five in dimes and nickels.<br>&#x201c;Come on, lady,&#x201c; the cabbie said, leaning over the passenger seat and looking up at her through the window. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t got all day.&#x201d;<br>Alicia made no sign she&#x2019;d heard him as she slowly pulled five singles from her wallet, one...at...a...time. Finally, when she had exactly six-seventy-five in her hand, she handed it through the window.<br>And waited.<br>It didn&#x2019;t take long--three seconds, tops--before the driver popped out his door and glared at her over the roof of his cab.<br>&#x201c;Ay! Where is tip?&#x201d; He pronounced it <em>teep</em>.<br>&#x201c;Pardon me?&#x201d; Alicia said sweetly. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t hear you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My tip, lady! Where is it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201c; she said, holding a hand to her ear. &#x201c;Your lips appear to be moving, but I can&#x2019;t hear a word you&#x2019;re saying. Something about my slip?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My tip, goddammit! <em>My tip! My tip! My fucking tip</em>!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Did I enjoy my trip?&#x201d; she said, then let her voice go icy. &#x201c;On a scale of one to ten, I enjoyed it zero...exactly the amount of your tip.&#x201d;<br>He made a move to come around the cab, probably figuring he could intimidate this slight, pale woman with the fine features and the glossy black hair, but Alicia held her ground. He gave her a venomous look and slipped back into his seat.<br>As she turned away, she heard the cabbie shout an inarticulate curse, slam his door, and burn rubber as he tore off.<br>We&#x2019;re even, she thought, her anger fading. But what an awful way to start a beautiful fall day.<br>She put it behind her. She&#x2019;d been looking forward to this meeting with Leo Weinstein, and she wasn&#x2019;t going to let some crazy cabbie upset her.<br>At last she&#x2019;d found an attorney who wasn&#x2019;t afraid to tackle a big law firm. All of the others she&#x2019;d tried--those in her limited price range--had reacted with a little too much awe when they&#x2019;d heard the name Hinchberger, Rainey &amp; Guran. Not Weinstein. Hadn&#x2019;t fazed him in the least. He&#x2019;d read through the will and within a day came up with half a dozen suggestions he seemed to believe would put the big boys on the defensive.<br>&#x201c;Your father left you that house,&#x201c; he&#x2019;d said. &#x201c;No way they can keep it from you. Just leave it to me.&#x201d;<br>And so she&#x2019;d done just that. Now she was going to see what he&#x2019;d accomplished with the blizzard of paper he&#x2019;d fired at Hinchberger, Rainey &amp; Guran.<br>She heard a honk behind her and stiffened. If it was that cab...<br>She turned and relaxed as she saw Leo Weinstein waving through the open window of a silver Lexus. He was saying something she couldn&#x2019;t catch. She stepped closer.<br>&#x201c;Good morning,&#x201c; she said.<br>&#x201c;Sorry I&#x2019;m late,&#x201c; he said. &#x201c;The LIE was jammed. Just let me pull into the garage down there and I&#x2019;ll be right with you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No problem.&#x201d;<br>She was almost to the front door of the building where Cutter and Weinstein had their offices when she was staggered by a thunderous noise. The shock wave slammed against her back like a giant hand and almost knocked her off her feet.<br>Turning she saw a ball of flame racing skyward from the middle of the block, and flaming pieces of metal crashing to the ground all about her. Cars were screeching to a halt as pedestrians dove for the pavement amid glittering shards of glass tumbling from windows up and down the block. Alicia jumped back as a blackened, smoking chunk of a car trunk lid landed in front of her and rolled to her feet.<br>An icy coil of horror tightened around her throat as she recognized the Lexus insignia.<br>She craned her neck to look for Leo&#x2019;s car, but it was...gone.<br>&#x201c;Oh, no!&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;Oh, my God, <em>no</em>!&#x201d;<br>She hurried forward a few steps on wobbly knees to see if there was anything she could do, but...the car...nothing was left where it had been...just burning asphalt.<br>&#x201c;Oh, God, Leo!&#x201d; she gasped. &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m so sorry!&#x201d;<br>She couldn&#x2019;t breathe. What had happened to all the air? She had to get away from here.<br>She forced her stricken body to turn and blunder back up the sidewalk, away from the smoke, the flames, the wreckage. She stopped when she reached Madison Avenue. She leaned against a traffic light post and gulped air. When she&#x2019;d caught her breath, she looked back.<br>Already the vultures were gathering, streaming toward the flames, wondering what happened. And not too far away, sirens.<br>She couldn&#x2019;t stay here. She couldn&#x2019;t help Weinstein and she didn&#x2019;t want to be listed as a witness. The police might get it into their heads that she was hiding something, and they might start looking into her background, her family. She couldn&#x2019;t allow that. Couldn&#x2019;t stand it.<br>Alicia didn&#x2019;t look for a taxi--the thought of being confined was unbearable. She needed space, light, air. She turned downtown.<br><em>Poor Leo</em>!<br>She sobbed as she started walking, moving as fast as her low-heeled shoes would allow. But even if she&#x2019;d worn her sneakers she would not have been able to outrun the guilt, the terrible suspicion that she was somehow responsible for Leo Weinstein&#x2019;s death.<br>Copyright � 1998 by F.

What attracts girls to male-dominated youth subcultures like the punk movement? What role does the subculture play in their perceptions of themselves, and in their self-esteem? How do girls reconcile a subcultural identity that is deliberately coded &#x201c;masculine&#x201d; with the demands of femininity?</p><p>Research has focused on the ways media and cultural messages victimize young women, but little attention has been paid to the ways they resist these messages. In Pretty in Punk, Lauraine Leblanc examines what happens when girls ignore these cultural messages, parody ideas of beauty, and refuse to play the games of teenage femininity. She explores the origins and development of the punk subculture, the processes by which girls decide to &#x201c;go punk,&#x201d; patterns of resistance to gender norms, and tactics girls use to deal with violence and harassment.</p><p>Pretty in Punk takes readers into the lives of girls living on the margins of contemporary culture. Drawing on interviews with 40 girls and women between the ages of 14-37, Leblanc examines the lives of her subjects, illuminating their forms of rebellion and survival. Pretty in Punk lets readers hear the voices of these women as they describe the ways their&nbsp; constructions of femininity&#x2014;from black lipstick to slamdancing&#x2014;allow them to reject damaging cultural messages and build strong identities. The price they pay for resisting femininity can be steep&#x2014;girls tell of parental rejection, school expulsion, institutionalization,&nbsp; and harassment.

When we lack peace, joy, or victory in our walk with Christ, oftentimes it&#39;s because we&#39;re not clear on how God&#39;s grace works in our lives. In some cases, the little misunderstandings can lead to more tragic results. It&#39;s safe to say that much incorrect Bible teaching and most cults get their start from the same place: an erroneous view of God&#39;s grace. &#34;Grace&#34; is a word we all hear frequently. We cannot help but sense there is something very special about God&#39;s grace. But do we really know what it is? And how it changes our lives? That&#39;s what the book of &#34;Galatians&#34; is all about. The book of &#34;Jude&#34; goes a step further and tells the results of those who stray from the gospel of grace. And both are brought together in David Levy&#39;s book, &#34;Guarding the Gospel of Grace: Contending for the Faith in the Face of Compromise.&#34; Learn about the difference that God&#39;s grace can make in your life...it&#39;s nothing less than amazing!</p><p>DAVID M.

Bush, the Bush Administration, Ann Coulter, Bill O&#x2019;Reilly, and scores of other conservatives whom, he says, are playing loose with the facts. It's a lot of ground to cover, as evidenced by the 43 chapters in <i>Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them</i>, but the results are often entertaining and insightful. Franken occupies a unique place in the modern political dialogue as perhaps the media's only comedy writer and performer who is also a Harvard fellow as well as a liberal political commentator. This unique and vaguely lonely position lends a charming quixotic quality to adventures such as a tense encounter with the Fox News staff at the National Press Club, a challenge to fisticuffs with National Review Editor Rich Lowry, and an oddly sweet admissions visit to ultra-conservative Bob Jones University (with a young research assistant posing as his son when Franken's real-life son refuses to participate in the charade). Less useful are comic book dramatizations of "Supply Side Jesus" and a fictitious Vietnam War story featuring the numerous righties who, Franken intimates, improperly avoided service. And Franken's criticisms of conservative talk show hosts Sean Hannity, O&#x2019;Reilly, and columnist Coulter, while admirable in their attention to detail, fail to shed much new light on people who have built careers on broad arguments and relentless self-aggrandizement. But Franken is at his best, and most compellingly readable, when he backs off the wackiness and the personal grudges and writes about more personal matters such as the political circus surrounding the memorial service of the late Senator Paul Wellstone. But even on these more serious topics, Franken's wit is still present and, in fact, grows sharper. In a time when much political discourse is composed of rage and shouting, it's refreshing that Al Franken is able to shout in a witty manner. <i>--John Moe</i>Al Franken is the bestselling author of <i>Oh, the Things I Know!, Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations, Why Not Me?</i>, and <i>I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough and Doggone It, People Like Me!</i></p><h2>Kali&#39;s Odiyya : A Shaman&#39;s True Story of Initiation</h2><p>A rare and exciting true story of worship and initiation in an culture that still exists today.

One day, after reading a book about Paris, he decides to pack a lunch and head for the city.&nbsp;</i><br><br><i>&#x201c;Like many of us Henri wants to see Paris.</i><br><br><i>In Paris, there are thousands of buses.

And this is when the story gets really charming. What Henri sees, we see, in a flowing panorama of pictures conceived by the eminent graphic designer Saul Bass.</p><p><b>Saul Bass</b> (1920&#x2013;1996) was a celebrated American graphic designer and filmmaker, but he is best known for his design on animated motion-picture title sequences. During his forty-year career he worked for some of Hollywood&#x2019;s greatest filmmakers, including most notably Alfred Hitchcock, Otto Preminger, Stanley Kubrick, and Martin Scorsese. Among his most famous title sequences are those for Preminger&#x2019;s <i>The Man with the Golden Arm</i>, and Hitchcock&#x2019;s North by <i>Northwest </i>and<i> Psycho</i>. <b>Leonore Klein</b> wrote the children&#x2019;s books <i>What Would You Do If . . .</i> (1956), <i>Mud, Mud, Mud </i>(1962), <i>Brave Daniel</i> (1966), and <i>Only One Ant</i> (1971), among many others. Besides writing books for children, Klein was a librarian in New York."No question, this is the kind of children&#x2019;s book that arty parents like to display in their Dwell-decorated nurseries. But it&#x2019;s also the kind of book that will stir a wandering spirit in imaginative children.

Filled with dazzling sun-bright colors, broad lines, and geometric shapes, the graphic artwork is crisp and imaginative. Characters and objects are depicted through eye-pleasing outlines and silhouettes, and the text is inventively integrated into the illustrations. Beginning with the cover, showing Henri's stepping shoes, the story's sense of motion is creatively conveyed through the visuals.

The waiting allowed time to savor the prospect of revenge.</p><p>It was rather pleasant sitting there, propped against a mossy tree, rifle at the ready. High summer in the Cascades was a very enjoyable time of year. True, the tourists clogged the narrow mountain roads and insisted on stopping at every lookout point to take photographs. They left their trash behind at the numerous picnic sites. But come fall they would be driven away by the heavy rains and high winds of the early storms. In winter snow would make the roads treacherous.</p><p>In the meantime the warm, gentle breeze stirring the branches carried the scents of the trees and the vegetation that thrived in the short growing season.</p><p>Now there was time to contemplate the past and all the injustices that could be laid at the feet of the man inside the cabin. While making preparations the killer had worried that when the moment finally arrived, there would be at least a few qualms. Instead there was only a great sense of certainty.</p><p>The door of the cabin opened. Gordon Greenslade came out onto the porch. He had always been a good-looking man and he was aging well. His hair had turned an attractive silver-white, not dull gray. He was still lean and fit and his aquiline features had softened only a little.</p><p>He had a mug of coffee in his hand. The killer recognized the mug. It was several years old, handmade and hand-painted. Like everything else in the rustic interior of the cabin, it was worn and faded.</p><p>These days Greenslade used the cabin primarily for hunting and fishing and when he just wanted to get away from the pressures that came with being the town&#x2019;s leading citizen. He owned the company that was the second-largest employer in town&#x2014;the college had taken first place in recent years. But more to the point, he owned the local politicians, the authorities of Loring College and a couple of state representatives. If the rumors were true, he also had at least one U.S. senator in his pocket.</p><p>Everybody in Loring respected Gordon Greenslade and a lot of people owed him in one way or another. He was a rigid, self-righteous pillar of the community. But no one really liked him. It would be entertaining to see how much effort the police put into investigating his death.</p><p>The killer rose and picked up the rifle. There was a clear line of sight. It would be easy to take the kill shot without being seen. But that would defeat the purpose. When you set out to walk the path of revenge you wanted your target to know who was pulling the trigger.</p><p>The killer moved out into the clearing in front of the cabin. It took Gordon a moment to notice that he had company. When he did, he was startled, but only briefly. Irritation soon replaced the surprise.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you doing here?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>The killer did not bother to respond. It was, after all, pretty damn obvious what was about to go down.</p><p>Belatedly Greenslade realized the rifle was aimed at him. Rage and panic flashed across his face.</p><p>He tried to retreat back into the cabin where he no doubt had a gun. But he didn&#x2019;t move fast enough. The bullet took him in the chest.</p><p>A head shot would have been too easy because death would have been instantaneous. This way there would be time for the killer to watch the target bleed out; time for Greenslade to comprehend that this was all about revenge.</p><p>The death of Gordon Greenslade was front-page news in the Loring Herald. There was genuine shock&#x2014;Greenslade had, after all, been the biggest mover and shaker in town&#x2014;but not a lot of genuine mourning. Still, everyone made a point of displaying the appropriate degree of respect for the deceased, because Gordon Greenslade&#x2019;s death had not changed the economic and political reality. The Greenslade family still controlled the second-largest employer in Loring and, indirectly, Loring&#x2019;s largest employer, the college. It existed solely because of the Greenslade endowment.</p><p>The police did their job and conducted an investigation. But in the end they came to the conclusion that the killer had anticipated: Gordon Greenslade had been killed in an accident. The shooter had been hunting out of season and probably hadn&#x2019;t even been aware that his wild shot had killed a man. In any event, it was unlikely that the person who had pulled the trigger would ever be found.</p><p>Everyone who lived in the area knew that the mountains were inherently dangerous. In the fall, heavy rains flooded the rivers to dangerous levels, sweeping away those who were unlucky enough to get caught in the rushing waters. Landslides blocked roads. Strong winds felled trees that could crush vehicles. In the winter, backcountry avalanches invariably took the lives of a few skiers and snowboarders every year. In the summer, it was inevitable that a hiker or two or three would fall into a crevasse or simply go missing forever.</p><p>And hunting accidents happened all the time in the mountains.</p><p></p></p><h2>The Compleat Ankh-Morpork: City Guide</h2><p>A brand-new street directory of Discworld city Ankh-Morpork complete with a beautifully illustrated pull-out map.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>'There's a saying that all roads lead to Ankh-Morpork.

It stood on the mantelpiece in the parlor, and every night before he went to bed he took the key from a vase, and wound it up. Once a year the clockman came from Winchester, on an old jogging packhorse, to clean and oil it and put it right. Afterward he would drink camomile tea with my mother, and tell her the news of the city and what he had learned in the villages through which he had passed. My father, if he were not busy milling, would stalk out at this time, with some contemptuous remark about gossip; but later, in the evening, I would hear my mother passing the stories on to him. He did not show much enthusiasm, but he listened to them. </p><p> My father's great treasure, though, was not the clock, but the Watch. This, a miniature clock with a dial less than an inch across and a circlet permitting it to be worn on the wrist, was kept in a locked drawer of his desk; and only brought out to be worn on ceremonial occasions, like Harvest Festival, or a Capping. The clockman was only allowed to see to it every third year, and at such times my father stood by, watching him as he worked. There was no other Watch in the village, nor in any of the villages round about. The clockman said there were a number in Winchester, but none as fine as this. I wondered if he said it to please my father, who certainly showed pleasure in the hearing, but I believe it truly was of very good workmanship. The body of the Watch was of a steel much superior to anything they could make at the forge in Alton, and the works inside were a wonder of intricacy and skill. On the front was printed "Anti-magnetique Incabloc," which we supposed must have been the name of the craftsman who made it in olden times. </p><p> The clockman had visited us the week before, and I had been permitted to look on for a time while he cleaned and oiled the Watch. The sight fascinated me, and after he had gone I found my thoughts running continually on this treasure, now locked away again in its drawer. I was, of course, forbidden to touch my father's desk and the notion of opening a locked drawer in it should have been unthinkable. Nonetheless, the idea persisted. And after a day or two, I admitted to myself that it was only the fear of being caught that prevented me. </p><p> On Saturday morning, I found myself alone in the house. My father was in the mill room, grinding, and the servants -- even Molly who normally did not leave the house during the day -- had been brought in to help. My mother was out visiting old Mrs. Ash, who was sick, and would be gone an hour at least. I had finished my homework, and there was nothing to stop my going out into the bright May morning and finding Jack. But what completely filled my mind was the thought that I had this opportunity to look at the Watch, with small chance of detection. </p><p> The key, I had observed, was kept with the other keys in a small box beside my father's bed. There were four, and the third one opened the drawer. I took out the Watch, and gazed at it. It was not going, but I knew one wound it and set the hands by means of the small knob at one side. If I were to wind it only a couple of turns it would run down quite soon -- just in case my father decided to look at it later in the day. I did this, and listened to its quiet rhythmic ticking. Then I set the hands by the clock. After that it only remained for me to slip it on my wrist. Even notched to the first hole, the leather strap was loose; but I was wearing the Watch. </p><p> Having achieved what I had thought was an ultimate ambition, I found, as I think is often the case, that there remained something more. To wear it was a triumph, but to be seen wearing it...I had told my cousin, Jack Leeper, that I would meet him that morning, in the old ruins at the end of the village. Jack, who was nearly a year older than myself and due to be presented at the next Capping, was the person, next to my parents, that I most admired. To take the Watch out of the house was to add enormity to disobedience, but having already gone so far, it was easier to contemplate it. My mind made up, I was determined to waste none of the precious time I had. I opened the front door, stuck the hand with the Watch deep into my trouser pocket, and ran off down the street. </p><p> The village lay at a crossroads, with the road in which our house stood running alongside the river (this giving power for the mill, of course) and the second road crossing it at the ford. Beside the ford stood a small wooden bridge for foot travelers, and I pelted across, noticing that the river was higher than usual from the spring rains. My Aunt Lucy was approaching the bridge as I left it at the far end. She called a greeting to me, and I called back, having first taken care to veer to the other side of the road. The baker's shop was there, with trays of buns and cakes set out, and it was reasonable that I should be heading that way: I had a couple of pennies in my pocket. But I ran on past it, and did not slacken to a walk until I had reached the point where the houses thinned out and at last ended. </p><p> The ruins were a hundred yards farther on. On one side of the road lay Spiller's meadow, with cows grazing, but on my side there was a thorn hedge, and a potato field beyond. I passed a gap in the hedge, not looking in my concentration on what I was going to show Jack, and was startled a moment later by a shout from behind me. I recognized the voice as Henry Parker's. </p><p> Henry, like Jack, was a cousin of mine -- my name is Will Parker -- but, unlike Jack, no friend. (I had several cousins in the village: people did not usually travel far to marry.) He was a month younger than I, but taller and heavier, and we had hated each other as long as I could remember. When it came to fighting, as it very often did, I was outmatched physically, and had to rely on agility and quickness if I were not going to be beaten. From Jack I had learned some skill in wrestling which, in the past year, had enabled me to hold my own more, and in our last encounter I had thrown him heavily enough to wind him and leave him gasping for breath. But for wrestling one needed the use of both hands. I thrust my left hand deeper into the pocket and, not answering his call, ran on toward the ruins. </p><p> He was closer than I had thought, though, and he pounded after me, yelling threats. I put a spurt on, looked back to see how much of a lead I had, and found myself slipping on a patch of mud. (Cobbles were laid inside the village, but out here the road was in its usual poor condition, aggravated by the rains.) I fought desperately to keep my footing, but would not, until it was too late, bring out my other hand to help balance myself. As a result, I went slithering and sprawling and finally fell. Before I could recover, Henry was kneeling across me, holding the back of my head with his hand and pushing my face down into the mud. </p><p> This activity would normally have kept him happy for some time, but he found something of greater interest. I had instinctively used both hands to protect myself as I fell, and he saw the Watch on my wrist. In a moment he had wrenched it off, and stood up to examine it. I scrambled to my feet, and made a grab, but he held it easily above his head and out of my reach. </p><p> I said, panting, "Give that back!" </p><p> "It's not yours," he said. "It's your father's." </p><p> I was in agony in case the Watch had been damaged, broken maybe, in my fall, but even so I attempted to get my leg between his, to drop him. He parried, and, stepping back, said, </p><p> "Keep your distance." He braced himself, as though preparing to throw a stone. "Or I'll see how far I can fling it." </p><p> "If you do," I said, "you'll get a whipping for it." </p><p> There was a grin on his fleshy face. "So will you. And your father lays on heavier than mine does. I'll tell you what: I'll borrow it for a while. Maybe I'll let you have it back this afternoon. Or tomorrow." </p><p> "Someone will see you with it." </p><p> He grinned again. "I'll risk that." </p><p> I made a grab at him, I had decided that he was bluffing about throwing it away. I almost got him off balance, but not quite. We swayed and struggled, and then crashed together and rolled down into the ditch by the side of the road. There was some water in it, but we went on fighting, even after a voice challenged us from above. Jack -- for it was he who had called to us to get up -- had to come down and pull us apart by force. This was not difficult for him. He was as big as Henry, and tremendously strong also. He dragged us back up to the road, got to the root of the matter, took the Watch off Henry, and dismissed him with a clip across the back of the neck. </p><p> I said tearfully, "Is it all right?" </p><p> "I think so." He examined it, and handed it to me. "But you were a fool to bring it out." </p><p> "I wanted to show it to you." </p><p> "Not worth it," he said briefly. "Anyway, we'd better see about getting it back. I'll lend a hand." </p><p> Jack had always been around to a lend a hand, as long as I could remember. It was strange, I thought, as we walked toward the village, that in just over a week's time I would be on my own. The Capping would have taken place, and Jack would be a boy no longer. </p><p> Jack stood guard while I put the Watch back and returned the drawer key to the place where I had found it. I changed my wet and dirty trousers and shirt, and we retraced our steps to the ruins. No one knew what these buildings had once been, and I think one of the things that attracted us was a sign, printed on a chipped and rusted metal plate: </p><p><br> DANGER<br> 6,600 VOLTS </p><p><br> We had no idea what Volts had been, but the notion of danger, however far away and long ago, was exciting. There was more lettering, but for the most part the rust had destroyed it. lect city: we wondered if that were the city it had come from. </p><p> Farther along was the den Jack had made. One approached it through a crumbling arch; inside it was dry, and there was a place to build a fire. Jack had made one before coming out to look for me, and had skinned, cleaned, and skewered a rabbit ready for us to grill. There would be food in plenty at home -- the midday meal on a Saturday was always lavish -- but this did not prevent my looking forward greedily to roast rabbit with potatoes baked in the embers of the fire. Nor would it stop me doing justice to the steak pie my mother had in the oven. Although on the small side, I had a good appetite. </p><p> We watched and smelled the rabbit cooking in companionable silence. We could get on very well together without much conversation, though normally I had a ready tongue. Too ready, perhaps -- I knew that a lot of the trouble with Henry arose because I could not avoid trying to get a rise out of him whenever possible. </p><p> Jack was not much of a talker under any circumstances, but to my surprise, after a time he broke the silence. His talk was inconsequential at first, chatter about events that had taken place in the village, but I had the feeling that he was trying to get around to something else, something more important. Then he stopped, stared in silence for a second or two at the crisping carcass, and said, </p><p> "This place will be yours, after the Capping." </p><p> It was difficult to know what to say. I suppose if I had thought about it at all, I would have expected that he would pass the den on to me, but I had not thought about it. One did not think much about things connected with the Cappings, and certainly did not talk about them. For Jack, of all people, to do so was surprising, but what he said next was more surprising still. </p><p> "In a way," he said, "I almost hope it doesn't work. I'm not sure I wouldn't rather be a Vagrant." </p><p> I should say something about the Vagrants. Every village generally had a few -- at that time there were four in ours, as far as I knew -- but the number was constantly changing as some moved off and others took their place. They occasionally did a little work, but whether they did or not the village supported them. They lived in the Vagrant House, which in our case stood on the corner where the two roads crossed and was larger than all but a handful of houses (my father's being one). It could easily have accommodated a dozen Vagrants, and there had been times when there had been almost that many there. Food was supplied to them -- it was not luxurious, but adequate -- and a servant looked after the place. Other servants were sent to lend a hand when the House filled up. </p><p> What was known, though not discussed, was that the Vagrants were people for whom the Capping had proved a failure. They had Caps, as normal people did, but they were not working properly. If this were going to happen, it usually showed itself in the first day or two following a Capping: the person who had been Capped showed distress, which increased as the days went by, turning at last into a fever of the brain. In this state, they were clearly in much pain. Fortunately the crisis did not last long; fortunately also, it happened only rarely. The great majority of Cappings were entirely successful. I suppose only about one in twenty produced a Vagrant. </p><p> When he was well again, the Vagrant would start his wanderings. He, or she; because it happened occasionally with girls, although much more rarely. Whether it was because they saw themselves as being outside the community of normal people, or because the fever had left a permanent restlessness in them, I did not know. But off they would go and wander through the land, stopping a day here, as long as a month there, but always moving on. Their minds, certainly, had been affected. None of them could settle to a train of thought for long, and many had visions, and did strange things. </p><p> They were taken for granted, and looked after, but, like the Cappings, not much talked about. Children, generally, viewed them with suspicion and avoided them. They, for their part, mostly seemed melancholy, and did not talk much, even to each other. It was a great shock to hear Jack say he half wished to be a Vagrant, and I did not know how to answer him. But he did not seem to need a response. He said, "The Watch -- do you ever think what it must have been like in the days when things like that were made?" </p><p> I had, from time to time, but it was another subject on which speculation was not encouraged, and Jack had never talked in this way before. I said, "Before the Tripods?" </p><p> "Yes." </p><p> "Well, we know it was the Black Age. There were too many people, and not enough food, so that people starved, and fought each other, and there were all kinds of sicknesses, and..." </p><p> "And things like the Watch were made -- by men, not the Tripods." </p><p> "We don't know that." </p><p> "Do you remember," he asked, "four years ago, when I went to stay with my Aunt Matilda?" </p><p> I remembered. She was his aunt, not mine, even though we were cousins: she had married a foreigner. Jack said, "She lives at Bishopstoke, on the other side of Winchester. I went out one day, walking, and I came to the sea. There were the ruins of a city that must have been twenty times as big as Win...</p></p><h2>A history of Ireland</h2><p>Peter and Fiona Somerset Fry present here a concise and enjoyable introduction to the history of Ireland. Starting in about 6,000 BC, they cover the neolithic, bronze, and iron ages, describing Irish tombs, artifacts, and buildings; the arrival of Christianity in Ireland; the golden age (500-800 AD.) when Irish scholars were the most renowned in Europe; the great Viking period; the takeover of Ireland by Henry II in 1171; the long and painful association with England; the struggle between Protestant and Catholic, colonial settler and native Irishman; and the fight for independence, achieved by the south in 1921. They take the story up to 1972, when the Northern Ireland parliament was suspended. Peter and Fiona Somerset Fry explain the origins of the present troubles in the north, emphasizing the line of continuity in religious faith and in social organization which still plays a key role in Ireland today. They do not put forward any cut-and-dry solution, but the book ends hopefully, reflecting the authors&#39; faith in the courage and intelligence of the different peoples of Ireland.</p><p></p><h2>Fighting Slave of Gor</h2><p>Emotionally lost, Jason Marshall finds himself thrust into a lengthy struggle to save his beloved from slavery on an Earthlike world called Gor.

Plagued by incessant rumination, the narrator&#x2019;s restless mind spins thread after thread of thought, fantasy, and memory into an elaborate tapestry spanning centuries and covering thousands of miles&#x2015;all without the narrator ever leaving his house. Hildesheimer famously refused to describe <i>Tynset</i> as a novel; instead, he chose to think of the work as an extended monologue whose structure derives from the musical rondo form, with the recurrence of the titular Norwegian town functioning as a refrain.</p><p>Wolfgang Hildesheimer (1916&#x2013;1991) was a German writer, dramatist, and painter known for his contributions to the so-called Theater of the Absurd, as well as his inventive treatments of the biographical genre. He was born in Hamburg, but studied and worked in England and Palestine before returning to Germany to serve as an interpreter in the Nuremberg Trials. He later became associated with the <i>Gruppe 47</i>, and in 1957 settled in Poschiavo, Switzerland, where he spent the remaining years of his life."An opaquely powerful work about obsession, delusion, repression, and guilt." -<b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, Starred Review</b></p><h2>Dead But Not Forgotten: Stories from the World of Sookie Stackhouse</h2><p><b>Discover the strange, supernatural residents of Bon Temps, Louisiana, like never before in this collection of stories from the world of Sookie Stackhouse.</b><br><br>The #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Sookie Stackhouse novels by Charlaine Harris spawned the hit TV show <i>True Blood&nbsp;</i>and captivated fans around the world&#x2014;including other authors.

I thought it would be strange to see my characters from someone else&#x2019;s viewpoint, and I thought it would be embarrassing to invite other writers to jump into my characters. But as I mulled the idea over for a few weeks, it occurred to me that I had already seen my characters from another viewpoint, on <i>True Blood</i>. Maybe seeing them through another prism would be just as interesting.</p><p>Gradually, I began to see how much fun this project might be, especially with Toni L. P. Kelner, friend and coeditor on so many anthologies, riding shotgun. We made up a list of writers who had let me know they&#x2019;d enjoyed the books. To my pleasure, they all seemed excited at the idea.</p><p>I have been delighted with the stories we received. Each one has provided me with a sort of affectionate good-bye to the world where I lived for so long, and the people I created to populate that world.</p><p></p><p></p><p>NOBODY&#x2019;S BUSINESS</p><p>RACHEL CAINE</p><p>Rachel Caine was enthralled by Kevin and Kenya, the Bon Temps police officers who appear in most of the Sookie books. She wanted to see more of their personal lives and to find out exactly how they came to realize they were really made for each other. Here&#x2019;s Rachel&#x2019;s version of their vampire-imperiled courtship, which also involves swamp water, addicts, and other assorted romantic shenanigans.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Hoo boy, it was hot. Though saying it was hot in Bon Temps, Louisiana, was a little like saying water was wet; even this late in the season, well into what probably felt like fall in other parts of the country, it was a sticky, steamy day. Like most other days.</p><p>Kevin Pryor reached for the controls of the air-conditioning on the police cruiser, but before he could get to them, his partner, Kenya Jones, was already there, expertly adjusting the knobs to get just the right mix of dry and cold. She also got out a thermos full of cold water, wetted a small washcloth, and handed it to him.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you saying I stink?&#x201d; he asked her, and made quick use of it, swabbing his filthy, sweaty face, neck, and hands. Not much he could do about the shirt; it was going to be one of those challenges that might be too big for regular laundry, and his mother would give him a lecture about taking better care of his things even though he was a grown-ass man.</p><p>Kenya didn&#x2019;t quite smile. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t say that.&#x201d; Which was her way of saying that she was too polite. In fact, he smelled like rot and swamp, because he&#x2019;d had to bend over and fish out the rotting suitcase from the green, stagnant pond and open it up to be sure there wasn&#x2019;t anything unpleasant in it, like body parts. There hadn&#x2019;t been. Just somebody&#x2019;s sad mess of clothes and some papers too rotted away to read.</p><p>They&#x2019;d gotten the call about a suitcase floating in the pond just an hour ago, and both of them had, without discussion, decided to put it at the top of their to-do list. Bon Temps was a sleepy little backwoods place, but it still had its more-than-fair share of meth-heads, criminals, losers, and killers.</p><p>Some of their killers were vampires.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t like to think <i>all</i> vampires were killers, because some of the ones he&#x2019;d met, like Bill Compton, generally seemed to be good people, wanting to live whatever kind of life they had without trouble, but he understood that there was a spectrum in the undead, like there was in the living. Good and bad and shades between. One thing he&#x2019;d learned early on as a cop: People were rarely on one side of the line or the other. Good people did bad things. Bad people did good things. You had to take it on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>&#x201c;That was strange, wasn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Kenya asked as she rewetted the washcloth and ran it over her exposed skin. He found himself watching that too closely, mind going blank, and had to blink and look away. Kenya was off-limits, obviously. First, she was his partner. Second, she was just about his polar opposite in every way&#x2014;Amazon tall, rounded, built like Venus, if Venus could bench-press the weight of a grown man. And she was black, which didn&#x2019;t matter to him a hill of beans, but he knew it mattered in the landscape of Bon Temps society. Such as that was. It most certainly mattered to his mother. She didn&#x2019;t even like him riding with Kenya all day; after all, she was from a generation that had gotten all froth-mouthed over <i>those people</i> going to the same restrooms.</p><p>He loved his mother. He just didn&#x2019;t like her very much.</p><p>&#x201c;You mean the suitcase?&#x201d; he asked, dragging his mind back to the case&#x2014;the <i>literal</i> case&#x2014;they were working on. &#x201c;Could have been some pissed-off boyfriend tossing his girl&#x2019;s clothes in the water during an argument. Or somebody&#x2019;s idea of recycling. No sign of foul play, at least. It&#x2019;s just junk.&#x201d;</p><p>Kenya nodded. She was frowning a little bit, but there hadn&#x2019;t been anything in the suitcase that either of them could point to as something that shouldn&#x2019;t have been tossed out. If there had been ID or a passport or cash or jewelry, that&#x2019;d be one thing, but an old, scarred Samsonite with one good latch filled with threadbare clothes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#x201c;All right,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll write it up in case something comes up on it. I checked missing persons. We got three, but none of them would fit the clothes in that bag.&#x201d;</p><p>The clothes had been for a generously sized woman without much sense of style. Generic stuff, sun-faded from flapping on a laundry line. Which, now that Kevin followed that train of thought along the tracks, didn&#x2019;t exactly support the theory of a spat with a girlfriend. Women of that age, and that particular style, didn&#x2019;t generally go in for fiery domestic arguments. When those kinds of women had fights, they were quiet, full of resentment, and the parties involved rarely threw things into stagnant ponds out of spite.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe we ought to head back,&#x201d; Kenya said, and cracked open the window. &#x201c;I am not going to be friendly all day long with that shirt.&#x201d;</p><p>It did stink pretty bad, and he could feel the sticky chill of it now that the A/C was drying the fabric, slimy against his chest. In this job, you tended to get accustomed to bad smells; a couple of bodies rotting in the hot Louisiana summer adjusted your nose real fast. But this was different.</p><p>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; he said, and put the cruiser in gear. &#x201c;Back to the barn.&#x201d;</p><p>Nothing in Bon Temps was a long drive, unless you went out into the fringe communities, and that was mostly about the quality of the roads, not the distance. So in under five minutes they were back on what passed for the main drag. They passed Merlotte&#x2019;s, which looked like it had a decent midday crowd going. He found himself craving lunch all of a sudden, and he caught Kenya&#x2019;s longing glance in that direction, too. Last thing he wanted was to wear swamp stink into a restaurant, though. Shower, fresh shirt, and then lunch.</p><p>Of course, it never happened.</p><p>They were a block away from the station when Marie Sandeman came running out in the street towing her ragged little boy along behind her and waved them down as if she were bringing in a jet for a landing.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding,&#x201d; Kenya said, and glowered at the woman. Marie was none too stable at the best of times, and this didn&#x2019;t look like it was going to be one of her better days. She hadn&#x2019;t combed her hair, and she probably hadn&#x2019;t slept much, either, from the dark rings around her eyes and the pale, sweaty set of her face. Thin as a stick insect, so thin he could see her ribs under the crop top she was wearing. Her kid didn&#x2019;t look much cleaner, but at least he was better fed. Kevin sincerely hoped that the broad, dark smear on the boy&#x2019;s cheek was mud.</p><p>&#x201c;You gotta help me!&#x201d; Marie shouted, and pounded on the hood of the police car for emphasis.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh hell, she did <i>not</i>,&#x201d; Kenya said, and had her door open before Kevin could turn off the engine. &#x201c;Marie Sandeman! Take your hands off the car!&#x201d;</p><p>Marie held up her hand in a trembling pledge to be good as she stepped back. Kenya fixed her with a blank, intimidating stare as Kevin exited the vehicle and came around to the front of the car near Marie. Kenya held back. It was the normal way they approached someone like Marie. He&#x2019;d made his peace with the fact that in their partnership, he was the <i>less</i> intimidating one.</p><p>&#x201c;You gotta help me,&#x201d; Marie repeated. Her little boy crumpled up a corner of his dirty, oversized Superman T-shirt and stuffed it in his mouth. His dark eyes were as wide as dinner plates. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s in my house!&#x201d;</p><p>That changed things, and Kevin heard it in the tone of his partner&#x2019;s voice as she said, &#x201c;Who is, Marie?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My dealer&#x2014;&#x201d; Her brain must have caught up with her mouth, because she stopped midconfession (it would have been drugs) and looked sideways. Marie was a real bad liar. &#x201c;His name&#x2019;s Quentin. He won&#x2019;t leave. He&#x2019;s tearin&#x2019; shit up in there!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is he high, Marie?&#x201d; Kenya managed to sound warm and calm and strong all at the same time. Mostly, Kevin figured, it was for the boy&#x2019;s benefit. They&#x2019;d handled Marie so many times that kindness had generally gone out the window, along with Marie&#x2019;s self-respect.</p><p>&#x201c;Probably&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d;</p><p>Kenya nodded to Kevin and got back into the cruiser. He delayed long enough to say, &#x201c;You go get yourself a soda or something, Marie. Don&#x2019;t go home until we deal with this, all right?&#x201d;</p><p>Marie might not be as smart as your average set of tools, but she understood an opening when she saw one. &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t got no money,&#x201d; she said, and took on a stubborn, defensive look. &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t my fault, I had to run out of there so fast!&#x201d;</p><p>Kenya didn&#x2019;t so much as blink. Kevin sighed, pulled out his wallet, and gave Marie a five, which she snatched from his fingers with rabid eagerness.</p><p>She looked down at her little boy as she stuffed the cash in her pocket. &#x201c;See? Cops ain&#x2019;t always bad. Just mostly.&#x201d;</p><p>Kevin shook his head and slammed the car door as Kenya flipped on the lights. No need for the siren. Marie didn&#x2019;t live that far away, and there wasn&#x2019;t any traffic to speak of between them and the destination.</p><p>&#x201c;I already hate this day,&#x201d; Kenya said. &#x201c;You know we have to go in her house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Bright side is, you won&#x2019;t notice how bad my shirt stinks anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>Marie&#x2019;s screen door was pretty useless, with a half-busted top hinge and most of the screen ripped into sharp-edged tatters. Old damage, rusty at the ends. Behind it, the front door hung wide open.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look good,&#x201d; Kenya said. &#x201c;Left or right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Left,&#x201d; Kevin said. She nodded, made a silent three-count, and eased into the darkness, going right. Kevin moved with her. They clicked their lights on within a second of each other.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t better than the last time he&#x2019;d seen the place. The floor was choked with discarded clothes, broken toys, bottles&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. basically the worst footing in the world if they had to move fast. Kevin swept the corners with his flashlight, but there was no sign of an intruder, unless you counted the roaches scurrying to avoid the glare. The stench of old diapers and rotting trash made the swampy aroma from his shirt seem almost soothing.</p><p>It was also hotter than hell. He guessed Marie had forgotten to pay the electric bill again, or else couldn&#x2019;t afford to. What she <i>could</i> afford was meth, and he spotted some on the coffee table, right next to the open pack of fruit snacks her kid had probably been eating. Time to call social services again.</p><p>He heard the shuffling sound the same time Kenya did, and both their lights moved to pinpoint the doorway that led into the kitchen. Kenya moved like a tiger as she closed the distance from the other side, and despite the fact that this was damn dangerous, Kevin couldn&#x2019;t help admiring her. Moments like these, she was so beautiful it hurt. Not that he&#x2019;d ever say so.</p><p>They paused on either side of the kitchen doorway, and Kenya gave him a nod, which was their sign that she&#x2019;d let him go in first and low, while she covered high. They both moved their lights to converge, and pinned the intruder in place in the beams.</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t exactly&#x2014;right. Kevin took that in at a glance&#x2014;the wide, wild, red-rimmed eyes; the matted long hair; the pallid face and red lips. Maybe he&#x2019;d come to Marie&#x2019;s house looking to score.</p><p>He was holding a dead cat. That was why his lips were so red, and dripping.</p><p>&#x201c;Jesus,&#x201d; Kenya said. She sounded disgusted. &#x201c;Drop the cat and put your damn hands up.&#x201d;</p><p>He dropped the cat, all right, but it turned out that in his other hand he had a gun, and he used it. He shot wild; the bullet buried itself in the wall a good three feet to the right. Kevin fired back and heard Kenya do the same.</p><p>One of them must have hit him, because the junkie yelped and staggered back as he dropped his gun.</p><p>Kevin surged forward. &#x201c;Down! Get down on the floor!&#x201d; A fate worse than death, to lie on that floor, but his heart was ripping itself loose in adrenaline-fueled pounding, and he wasn&#x2019;t feeling particularly sympathetic.</p><p>The wild man bared stained teeth at him and knocked Kevin out of his way as easily as if he were a blow-up toy. It felt like being hit by a sledgehammer in the chest, and Kevin was aware of leaving the ground, a second of motion, and then a hard, rattling impact against the solid bulk of the refrigerator.</p><p>Kenya let out a wordless yell and fired, but the man was damn fast as well as damn strong, and she missed him as he smashed through the cloudy back window of the kitchen, launching himself out to the straggly grass of the lawn. He was already at a dead run when Kevin staggered forward to look. He couldn&#x2019;t seem to get his lungs to work, and for a panicked second or two he thought his chest had been crushed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then his paralyzed solar plexus let go, and he whooped in a hungry breath.</p><p>Kenya was right there, holding him up while he got his legs under him again. &#x201c;You all right?&#x201d; she asked, and he nodded without speaking and motioned her on. She gave him a doubting look but kicked open the back door and sprinted after the intruder, who had already vaulted the back fence.</p><p><i>Get it together,</i> Kevin told himself, and stumbled through the mess of the living room out to the front yard, then to the cruiser. Once inside, he caught his breath and turned the key. It was as if gunning the engine started something inside him, too, and he snapped back into focus with a vengeance. Still shaking, but this time it was with pure, white-hot rage.</p><p><i>You&#x2019;re not going anywhere, you fucker,</i> he thought. He&#x2019;d never say it out loud, because he&#x2019;d been raised polite, but he meant every word.</p><p>He whipped the cruiser into a roaring turn and hit the sirens and lights, taking the next corner at a skid. Up ahead, Kenya was running hard and gaining on the intruder, who was just crossing the block up ahead. Kevin missed the man as he dodged and went sharply left up a narrow alley&#x2014;too narrow for the cruiser. Kenya waved him on around, and he hit the gas again and took a left to run parallel with their fleeing cat-killer. It was a long block. His radio crackled as he took the turn to cut the man off, and he heard Kenya&#x2019;s voice say, &#x201c;Kevin, he&#x2019;s got a truck, repeat, he&#x2019;...</p></p><h2>Prayers from a Mom&#39;s Heart</h2><p>From Fern Nichols, the respected founder of Moms in Touch, comes this practical yet beautiful gift book.

Maxwell told a grandson of Henry Eyring&#39;s, You need to write your grandfather&#39;s story. This is that story of Henry Eyring, perhaps the most acclaimed scientist ever to come from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is a book about science and Mormonism, written to be easily understood by newcomers to both subjects. It demonstrates why one of the Church&#39;s highest-profile intellectuals was also one of its humblest believers. In fact, this story of Henry Eyring shows how intellect and belief go hand-in-hand and how simple, faithful people can change the world.</p><p>Henry J. Eyring is a grandson of Henry Eyring. He attended Brigham Young University, earning a bachelors degree in geology and graduate degrees in business administration and law. He has worked as a consultant for Monitor Company, as director of the BYU MBA program, and as president of the Japan Tokyo North Mission of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He is currently an administrator at BYU-Idaho. He and his wife, Kelly, are the parents of five children, and they live in Rexburg, Idaho.This interesting biography of Henry Eyring, a famed and charismatic Mormon scientist, is revealing about both the man&#39;s intellectual acuity and scientific accomplishments as well as his powerful personal impact on people. Eyring, while educated at Princeton and known for excellence in research, returned to Utah to raise his family. In both New Jersey and Utah, he made an impression as a down-to-earth, genuinely funny human being who made a deep impression on young people struggling with religion and science. His grandson, Henry J. Eyring, whose academic degrees are in geology, business administration and law, has effectively captured his illustrious relative. --Deseret News</p><h2>Pioneers of Modern Design: From William Morris to Walter Gropius (Pelican Books)</h2><p>This is a book on artists and architects from Britain, USA and Europe and how the best remains today where laid by a small group of people who thought and taught as well as designed.</p><p>Nikolaus Pevsner&#x2019;s study of the history of modern design, first published in 1936, is a classic text that offers an unrivalled account of the roots of Modernism.

July 5, 1968</p><p><i>The ring of the bell was hard and furious, piercing the night and shattering the quiet depths of the small hours. It rang with a shrill quality of urgency and menace, hammering savagely, relentlessly, permeating the stagnant, suffocating air of the empty streets and shadowed lawns. The clanging brutally woke him from the oblivion of sleep. He leapt from his bed and ran to the window, anticipating an orange glow from the nearby downtown, but there was none. The fire was somewhere in the countryside.</i></p><p><i>He dressed quickly and ran downstairs. The kitchen light was on, his mother waiting. She stood by with folded arms and a pale, ghostly face of tacit worry. As he rushed to the front door, her timid voice followed him with the familiar words of caution. He stopped, walked back to her, and kissed her on the cheek. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your big day. I&#x2019;ll come back safe.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The blistering, brassy tongue of the bell continued as he sprinted the three blocks to the fire hall. One by one, the houses along the street were lighting up. Out from the dark vault of night, the town was coming alive.</i></p><p><i>At the firehouse, the pump truck was already out on the pavement, poised to charge forward. It was a spectacle of bulk and power, a rolling fortress of steel and rails and magnificent lights. The great engine was idling, forcing the warm night air to shudder and vibrate. Men were running, shouting, rushing to grab their gear, bumping chaotically against one another in a furious effort to slide into coats and boots. And above the roar and confusion was the thunderous voice of the fire chief. Standing on the rear mount bumper of the truck, he was yelling for them to come, now, now, now.</i></p><p><i>Eighteen and nimble, he was the youngest in the volunteer service. He moved among them effortlessly, geared up quickly, and was one of the first to mount the ride bumper on the side of the truck. He stepped on and grabbed the rail. As the others arrived, they regarded him with astonishment, questioning him.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;What are you doing here? Don&#x2019;t you leave in the morning?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Sleep didn&#x2019;t matter to him. It would be a long bus ride to Fort Polk. He could rest on the way. Vietnam would still be there.</i></p><p><i>�Half-�suited men were still clumsily chasing the truck as it began to pull away, launching itself with the slow ebbing wail of the long siren. The truck accelerated quickly. The ride was wild, noisy, insane. He held the rail firmly, his heart pounding.</i></p><p><i>Soon they left behind the sterile streetlights of downtown and were bounding headlong into the black and desolate countryside. Men were shouting, trying to be heard above the deafening blow of the wind and the siren.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Where is it?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Another man answered above the din. &#x201c;Out Gallivant&#x2019;s Crossing. Some farmer called it in.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The words shook him. This was an odd, sobering coincidence. He had returned from Gallivant&#x2019;s Crossing only a few hours earlier. He tightened his grip against the reckless and exhilarating lunges of the turns. They rode on, the truck pitching and heaving, slinging them in unison.</i></p><p><i>Someone shouted into the howling noise. &#x201c;Is it a house?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>An answer came from someone down the line. &#x201c;Not sure.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>They turned onto Gallivant&#x2019;s Crossing and drove for several miles into the rolling hills and thick woods where only a few isolated farms dotted the vast black landscape. There the world slept, illuminated by a solitary barnyard light that cast its frail luster into the shadows. These �far-�flung islands of life seemed soundless, timeless, blissfully removed from the surge and clamor of the wailing truck. They roared onward, into the uncertain darkness.</i></p><p><i>He knew this road. And with each mile, each hill, each turn, his heart began to sink slowly within him, flooding him with dread.</i></p><p>Surely not there,<i> he thought to himself. </i>Surely not the cottage.</p><p><i>The truck slowed, its driver in doubt of the fire&#x2019;s location. They topped the last hill before Mercy Creek Road, and the glow in the near distance was easily discerned. The truck made the tight turn down the narrow chert road and advanced with what speed it could toward the blaze. Trees crowded the sides of the lane, their branches brushing against the men.</i></p><p><i>One of them shouted out, &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t right, boys. We&#x2019;re on the fringe of Mennonite country. What are we doing here?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>A cry came back. &#x201c;Putting out a fire, you idiot.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;You watch, genius. They won&#x2019;t let us get close.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The truck emerged from the trees as the lane cleared on the left to a small flat meadow tucked neatly between nearby hills. The massive engine turned onto the long drive and stopped. One hundred yards ahead, lighting up the night sky, was a small frame house, burning furiously. They could see dozens of shouting men. His thoughts raced. Why had the truck stopped?</i></p><p><i>The men began to step off and gather in small groups, staring at the distant blaze. The fire chief walked leisurely down the drive. Two men in �broad-�brim hats came to meet him. After a short discussion, the chief walked back.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;False alarm, boys. They&#x2019;ve got a bucket brigade going from a pond out back. They&#x2019;re just going to let the fire burn itself out and water down the perimeter to keep it from getting into the field.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Anybody hurt?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Nah. Apparently the house was empty. They only use it for storage.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The chief turned and stared at the fire for a moment. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll stay for a bit . . . just stand by at the ready in case it gets out of hand.&#x201d; He paused and shook his head. &#x201c;You know these Mennonite boys. They don&#x2019;t like outsiders getting involved, even if it&#x2019;s for their own good.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>He stared at the chief and stood silently, his nauseating panic slowly replaced by a sullen, bitter resentment. He knew all about this abandoned house, but he said nothing. He only watched. He knew who had started the fire, and he knew why.</i></p><p><i>And he wasn&#x2019;t the only one.</i></p><p><i>For decades, they would keep their silence, blinded by their anger.</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>Memorial Day, Watervalley, Tennessee</p><p>As a doctor, I tend not to be superstitious.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t believe in ghosts, or that eating an apple a day will keep you well, or that a rabbit&#x2019;s foot will bring good luck, unless you&#x2019;re a rabbit.</p><p>However, numbers might be the exception. I&#x2019;ve come to think of certain numbers as lucky, others not. For me, six is an unlucky number, seven can go either way, and the luckiest number of all is three.</p><p>But that notion changed on Memorial Day. During my frantic rush to the softball field to save Toy McAnders&#x2019;s life, I painfully recalled my med school professor&#x2019;s lecture about the Rule of Threes. This was the lecture about death.</p><p>On average, the human body can live for three weeks without food, three days without water, and three hours after subthermal exposure. These lousy situations share one small positive. Typically, they don&#x2019;t involve panic. The mind has time: time to process, to plan, to hope.</p><p>Lack of oxygen is a different matter. The &#x201c;game over&#x201d; bell on an �oxygen-�deprived body is about three minutes. It terrifies us. We panic. It&#x2019;s in our DNA.</p><p>And panic is contagious. Watching someone desperately gasp for breath creates a sympathetic physical response. It&#x2019;s automatic. . . .&nbsp;Heart rate and respiration accelerate, pupils dilate, skin perspires, and panicked people tend to talk in �high-�pitched gibberish. Understanding them is like trying to have a conversation with Flipper. Unfortunately, being a doctor doesn&#x2019;t make you immune.</p><p>So as I was heading out the door on that Memorial Day afternoon, I was thinking about barbecued ribs and fireworks and the beautiful smile awaiting my arrival. The ring of my cell phone changed everything.</p><p>&#x201c;Dr. Bradford! Oh, thank God! He can&#x2019;t breathe! How soon can you get here?&#x201d;</p><p>Startled, I blurted my response. &#x201c;Hello, hello, who is this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Sarah, Sarah McAnders. I . . . Help us. Can you come! He can&#x2019;t breathe!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sarah! Slow down. Who can&#x2019;t . . . Where are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At the softball park. He&#x2019;s not breathing, Dr. Bradford. He&#x2019;s choking! Oh my God! What do we do?&#x201d;</p><p>I began to run toward my car.</p><p>&#x201c;Who are we talking about? Who&#x2019;s choking? Is it Sam?&#x201d; Sarah was the young mother of a �one-�year-�old son.</p><p>&#x201c;No, no. It&#x2019;s Toy! The softball . . . His throat . . . It hit his throat! Where are you?&#x201d;</p><p>I was trying to keep calm, stay focused, but a dozen thoughts were fumbling through my head and the blasted car wouldn&#x2019;t start. I looked down and realized I was trying to use my house key in the ignition. Like I said, panic is contagious.</p><p>&#x201c;Sarah, how long ago did it happen?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just now! I mean, l don&#x2019;t know. Maybe a minute ago!&#x201d;</p><p>If this was correct, it was the only spark of good news. Toy was her husband, a strong athletic man in his �mid-�twenties. I looked at my watch. The softball park was five minutes away. My hope was that Toy&#x2019;s windpipe wasn&#x2019;t completely closed. That would buy me time.</p><p>&#x201c;Sarah, I&#x2019;m on my way. I&#x2019;m going to hang up and call the EMTs. I&#x2019;ll get there as fast as I can. Do you understand?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes! Yes! I think so. Please hurry!&#x201d;</p><p>I squealed onto Fleming Street.</p><p>A quick phone call got the EMTs at the fire station moving. They would be only a minute behind me. This was the hazard of being the sole physician in a remote Tennessee town. When emergencies occurred, there was no bench of reserve players. With my staff nurse out of town, the EMTs and I were it.</p><p>Fortunately, the softball park was a direct shot out Shiloh Road, set apart from the downtown, away from either one of Watervalley&#x2019;s two traffic lights. I put my emergency flashers on and pressed hard on the gas pedal. I needed to calm myself, to think clearly. I ran various scenarios through my head, trying to anticipate what I would do upon my arrival. I checked my watch. A minute and a half had passed.</p><p>The air passage to the lungs, the larynx, is made of flexible rings and typically bounces back . . . unless the impact crushes it along with the hyoid bone, better known as the Adam&#x2019;s apple. In that case, there are hemorrhaging and swelling that force the airway closed. But swelling takes time, and time was what I, and Toy McAnders, needed.</p><p>The damnable Rule of Threes was hounding me.</p><p>There was little traffic. I managed to pass one or two cars. Thankfully, a few pulled over to let me by, recognizing my Corolla with its flashing lights. Again I checked my watch. Two and a half minutes had passed. I might just make it.</p><p>Then, everything stopped.</p><p>After rounding a curve less than a half mile from the ballpark, I had to slam on the brakes to keep from �rear-�ending the car in front of me. Stretched in a long line ahead was a row of vehicles at a complete standstill.</p><p>It was unthinkable. Traffic jams simply didn&#x2019;t happen in Watervalley, and yet at this �ill-�timed moment, that was what lay before me. The road ahead curved with woods on either side, limiting my vision. This made no sense. There were no police sirens, and dispatch at the fire station hadn&#x2019;t mentioned anything.</p><p>I pulled the Corolla into the vacant oncoming lane. After a hundred yards, I had rounded the curve far enough to see the problem. Ahead was a flatbed truck stopped in the middle of the road. Strewn everywhere were slatted wooden crates, each the size of a large suitcase. Some were flipped sideways, some upended, some busted. All were filled with chickens. Stacked and strapped onto the truck bed, the crates had apparently come undone and spilled over the road and shoulder, completely blocking traffic.</p><p>Volunteers were casually helping the farmer reload the crates. I laid on my horn as I approached. From around the corner of the truck, heads appeared with irritated faces at the impatient honking. A couple of men recognized me and began to walk toward my approaching car.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on, Doc?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You gotta let me through, fellows. There&#x2019;s an emergency at the ballpark.&#x201d;</p><p>They exchanged glances and immediately ran back toward the others.</p><p>&#x201c;Make a hole, boys! Doc needs to get by!&#x201d;</p><p>Time came to a standstill. I tapped my finger rapidly on the steering wheel, and in those dead seconds of waiting, I started to feel that �heavy-�throated, sickening apprehension that everything was going south. Panic was overtaking me, screaming into my consciousness. Too much time! Too much time!</p><p>By now the EMT van was behind me. Six minutes had passed since Sarah&#x2019;s call, twice the threshold of the Rule of Threes. I was sweating, short of breath, consumed with a nauseating reality: Toy McAnders was probably dead.</p><p>I finally passed through, accelerated down the ballpark entrance, and pulled directly onto the field, where a large crowd circled the pitcher&#x2019;s mound. The EMT van followed. I slammed on my brakes, burning long ruts in the grass. In one fluid motion I grabbed my physician&#x2019;s bag and was out the car door, running headlong toward the center of the crowd. Instinctively people moved aside, availing a large opening. I halted in midstep three feet away from Toy, stunned at the sight before me.</p><p>Toy McAnders was seated on the ground against a stack of athletic bags. Protruding from the small of his throat were two large drinking straws. Sarah was standing beside him, a hand covering her mouth. A woman I had never met was on her knees next to Toy, calmly giving him instructions. Blood covered the front of his shirt, but he was alive.</p><p>The woman was intermittently dabbing a cloth around the tracheal opening made in Toy&#x2019;s neck, trying to check the bleeding. The setup was gruesome and unnatural looking. He had a weak consciousness and was struggling to breathe. But he was alive.</p><p>I dropped to a knee on Toy&#x2019;s opposite side.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Dr. Bradford.&#x201d;</p><p>The woman, who looked to be in her �mid &#x2013; to late thirties, nodded and continued to address Toy&#x2019;s mild bleeding as she spoke.</p><p>&#x201c;This fellow looked away after a pitch, and the softball caught him square in the throat. Smacked him pretty hard. At the �four-�minute mark, he lost consciousness. I made an incision over the suprasternal notch and a lateral incision into the trachea, enough to get the two straws inserted. From what I can tell, heart rate is about one twenty, jugular pressure seems good, respirations are around thirty. It looks bad, but I estimate only about thirty milliliters of blood loss. I had to use my pocketknife, so he&#x2019;ll need an antibiotic. He lost consciousness for about ninety seconds, long enough for me to insert the straws.&#x201d;</p><p>She wore jeans and a T-shirt. She was small in size but athletic looking with brownish blond hair cropped in a pageboy. She had methodically given me a thorough medical �report&#x2014;�clearly something she had done before.</p><p>By now the EMTs, Clarence and Leonard, were beside me with the gurney. We quickly lifted Toy onto it and into the van, where we could fully monitor him for transport to Regional Hospital in the next county.</p><p>Once Toy was loaded, I turned to the woman, extending my hand. &#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t met.&#x201d;</p><p>...</p></p><h2>Flower Confidential: The Good, the Bad, and the Beautiful in the Business of Flowers</h2><p>Award-winning author Amy Stewart takes readers on an around-the-world, behind-the-scenes look at the flower industry and how it has sought&#x2014;for better or worse&#x2014;to achieve perfection.

They've become big business&#x2014;created in laboratories, bred in test tubes, grown in factories, harvested by machines, packed into boxes, sold at auctions, and then flown across oceans and continents to your supermarket or local florist. Amy Stewart tracks down the hybridizers, geneticists, growers, and vendors working to invent, manufacture, and sell flowers that are bigger, brighter, and sturdier than anything nature can provide. From big agribusiness to local farming, from Europe to Latin America, <i>Flower Confidential</i> explores the intersection of nature and technology, of sentiment and commerce.</p><h2>What&#39;s Doin&#39; the Bloomin&#39;? Revised Edition:A Pictorial Guide to Wildflowers of the Upper Great Lakes Regions, Eastern Canada and Northeastern U. S. A.</h2><p>A pictorial field guide to wildflowers, organized by season of bloom, for the Upper Great Lakes Regions, Eastern Canada and Northeastern USA. A comprehensive guide with over 340 species of native and naturalized plants, it is illustrated with more than 620 full color photos showing flowers, stems and leaves, fruits and habitat to better aid in identification. Sections on grasses and sedges, vines, flowering woody plants and ferns (plants without flowers) are included. Each species is described and identified by common and scientific names. Short guides to the naming of plants and how to use the book get the reader off to a fast start to use it efficiently. A section describing plant families along with indexes of common and scientific names and a bibliography round out the book. The Smyth-sewn binding and laminated cover give it durability.</p><p>This field guide was designed to be a &#34;fun to use book.&#34; Traditional style and format for field guidebooks were put aside to stimulate interest and to let the photos and topics dictate the presentation of each species included in the book. Some species are presented on two pages; habitat is included when space and need dictates. A one page section titled &#34;Where to Find Them&#34; gives useful hints on how to use the book effectively. Another introductory page titled &#34;Name, Rank and Plant Family&#34; provides an explanation of scientific versus common names. The guide clearly uses both plant names in separate indexes for ease of identification. The authors indicate that no single field guidebook is complete. Companion books with line drawings and more detailed descriptions will aid the most serious wildflower enthusiast.The authors are retired educators and perennial people: Michele, a former music teacher and long-time gardener: Clayton, a botany/horticulture professor. Plants and gardening are a passion with them. When the demands of the work world eased, their curiosity about plants combined with dreams of writing a book Hawaiian Gardens are to Go to, published in 1998, as a result of their experience in conducting educational tours through the botanical gardens of Hawaii.

It is true for me. I&#x2019;m alone on the beach watching the blood-red sun baptized in the Gulf of Mexico. And there is no returning to what I left behind. </p><p>The air is saturated with the smells of salt water and kelp and the sounds of breaking waves and screeching seagulls. Some part of me wonders if this might be a dream and hopes I&#x2019;ll wake in bed and find that I&#x2019;m still in Seattle, and McKale is gently running her fingernails up and down my back. She would whisper, &#x201c;Are you awake, my love?&#x201d; I would turn to her and say, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never believe what I just dreamed.&#x201d; </p><p>But it&#x2019;s no dream. I&#x2019;ve walked the entire length of the country. And the woman I love is never coming back. </p><p>The water before me is as blue as windshield wiper fluid. I feel the twilight breeze against my unshaven, sunburned face, and I close my eyes. I&#x2019;ve come a long way to get here&#x2014;nearly 3,500 miles. But, in ways, I&#x2019;ve come much further. Journeys cannot always be measured in physical distance. </p><p>I slide the backpack off my shoulders and sit down on the sand to untie my shoes and pull off my socks. My threadbare, once white, now-gray cotton socks stick to my feet as I peel them off. Then I step forward on the wet, shell-studded sand and wait for the receding water to return and cover my feet. I&#x2019;ve had hundreds of hours to think about this moment, and I let it all roll over me: the wind, the water, the past and present, the world I left behind, the people and towns along the way. It&#x2019;s hard to believe I&#x2019;m finally here. </p><p>After a few minutes, I go back and sit cross-legged in the sand next to my pack and do what I always do at the pivotal moments of my life: I take out a pen, open my diary, and begin to write. </p><blockquote><p></p><p>My writing habit began long ago&#x2014;long before this diary, long before my walk. The Christmas I was eight years old, my mother gave me my first diary. It was a small, yellow vinyl book debossed with deep flourishes. My favorite feature was its brass key and lock. It made me feel important to have something in my life of such consequence that I needed to lock it up from the world. That Christmas night was the first time in my life that I wrote in a diary. I figured with the lock and all, only I would be reading it, so I wrote the entry to myself, a habit I would continue the rest of my life.</p><p><i>Dear Alan,</i></p><p><i>Today is Christmas. I got a Rock&#x2019;em Sockem Robots, a set of walky-talkys and red sweetish fish that I already ate. Mom gave me this diary with a lock and key and told me I should write every day. I asked her to write on my first page.</i></p><p>My Dear Son,</p><p>Thank you for letting me write in your special book. And Merry Christmas! It is a very special Christmas.<br>You will someday understand this. Every so often read these words and remember how much I love you and always will.</p><p>&#x2014;Mom</p><p><i>Mom says it doesn&#x2019;t matter what I write and if I wait to write just the importent things then I&#x2019;ll probly never write anything, because importent things just look like everything else except when you look back on them. The thing is to write what yor thinking and feelling. Mom looked better today. I think she&#x2019;ll be better soon.</i></p></blockquote> <p>I&#x2019;ve touched that writing so often that it&#x2019;s barely legible. My mother&#x2019;s entry was one of those events she spoke of, the kind that look like nothing except through time&#x2019;s rearview mirror. My mother died from breast cancer forty-nine days later&#x2014;on Valentine&#x2019;s Day. </p><p>It was early in the morning, before I usually got up for school, that my father led me into the room to see her. On the nightstand next to her bed there was a single yellow rose in a bud vase and my homemade Valentine&#x2019;s card, with a drawing of a heart with an arrow through it. Her body was there, but she wasn&#x2019;t. She would have smiled and called to me. She would have praised my drawing. I knew she wasn&#x2019;t there. </p><p>In my father&#x2019;s typical stoic manner, we never spoke about her death. We never talked about feelings nor the things that gave rise to them. That morning he made me breakfast, then we sat at the table, listening to the silence. The people from the mortuary came and went, and my father managed everything with the steadiness of a business transaction. I&#x2019;m not saying he didn&#x2019;t care. He just didn&#x2019;t know how to show his feelings. That was my father. I never once kissed him. That&#x2019;s just the way he was. </p><table><tbody><tr>Note</tr><tr><td><p><i>The reason we start things is rarely the reason we continue them.</i></p><p></p>Alan Christoffersen&#x2019;s Road Diary</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>I started writing in my diary because my mother told me to. After her death, I continued because to stop would be to break a chain that connected me to her. Then, gradually, even that changed. I didn&#x2019;t realize it at the time, but the reason I wrote was always changing. As I grew older, I wrote as proof of my existence. I write, there-<br>fore <i>I am</i>. </p><p><i>I am.</i> In each of us, there is something that, for better or worse, wants the world to know we existed. This is my story&#x2014;my witness of myself and the greatest journey of my life. It began when I least expected it.

Accompanying Ruby's first US museum survey, this book takes a thematic approach to the artist's work, focusing on his critical invocation of imagery related to American identity. Beginning with his earliest collages, this book demonstrates his distinctive approach to psychological, cultural, and topical concerns. It includes his recent mobiles and polyurethanes, demonstrating his continuous engagement with themes such as prison reform, labor conditions, and vernacular cultures. Readers can compare smaller works on canvas and in clay to monumental sculptures made from submarine parts or giant skyscrapers rendered in toxically bright colors.<br><br><b>Published with ICA Miami and ICA/Boston</b></p><p>ALEX GARTENFELD is Artistic Director at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami.<br><br>EVA RESPINI is Barbara Lee Chief Curator at the Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston.</p><h2>Star Wars: The Life and Legend of Obi-Wan Kenobi</h2><p>The Life and Legend of Obi-Wan Kenobi</p><p></p><h2>A Lover&#39;s Almanac</h2><p>A daring attempt to decipher the mysteries of how and why two people fall in love underscores the romance of two young lovers--Artie, a boyish computer wiz from New York and Louise, a committed artist from the Midwest. Tour.</p><p>The attempt here--a novel as expansive as an almanac, with a bit of everything in it--raises Howard's latest sometimes to considerable heights but as often slows it to a crawl through lives and commentary not always interesting enough for the trip. Louise Moffett, b. 1968, comes to New York from Wisconsin to find her fortune as an artist, and in doing so becomes the lover (later the mate) of gifted ne'er-do-well Artie Freeman. We meet the two at a party on the last night of the 20th century--when Artie proposes but, due to extreme drunkenness, flubs the moment, offends Lou, finds himself exiled from her downtown loft--and retreats to his grandfather Cyril's Fifth Avenue apartment. Moving from winter solstice to spring equinox, Howard's novel follows the lovers as they mope, pine, and are reunited, while those same three winter months afford plenty of space to fill in family backgrounds. Lou's farmer-scientist father (a prof in animal husbandry) failed to understand his daughter's emerging art, her mother went underappreciated, and research scientist Aunt Bea provided a role-model of dedication to her calling. As for math whiz yet school-dropout Artie: His unmarried ex-hippie mother, now dead, never revealed who his father was, leaving Artie eternally in a paternity search; and his widowed grandfather, Cyril, after a Wall Street career, retreated into books of American history--emerging only to continue a romance begun 50 years earlier with Sylvie Neiswonger, who, at 12, fled the Nazis through a backyard in Austria after being raped by a German soldier. Throughout, Howard sprinkles bits of zodiacal lore, rhymes of planting advice, snippets of biographies (Edison, Haydn, Mendel) remarks about computers, electronics, the information glut--all symbolically converging in Lou's newest gallery show of family lore, trinkets, cast-offs, and (literally) broken hearts. A worthy gathering--sometimes Dos Passos, sometimes Faulkner, sometimes Howard--that would have offered greater pleasures, as almanac and otherwise, at, say, two thirds its length. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Howard, a quietly prodigious literary talent on a par with Margaret Atwood, Mary Gordon, and Anne Tyler, loves to bend nonfiction forms to fictional purposes. The title of her last novel, <i>Natural History</i> (1992), alludes to its pseudoscientific structure, and here she improvises on the concept of an almanac, surrounding a classic love story with bits of astrology, meteorology, history, and miscellaneous observations. She also plays at predicting the future, setting her tale in January 2000, but it is the past that most concerns her brooding characters. Louise, a painter, and Artie, her orphan lover, have a battle royal at her New Year Eve's party and suffer, in the aftermath, several months of separation, an interlude that causes them to reflect on their complicated family histories. As they slowly realign, like heavenly bodies destined for a celestial event, Howard punctuates her affecting narrative with almanaclike entries about such subjects as ancient Egypt, Benjamin Franklin, and Virginia Woolf, exploring, along the way, the often unexpected consequences of acts both creative and destructive. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>For What It&#39;s Worth: Business Wisdom from a Pawnbroker</h2><p><b>Businesses these days talk a lot about figuring out what the customer wants.

Mackenzie feels alive again, but as the number of conspirators grows to include professional criminals, the rank amateurs&#x2019; perfect crime begins to unravel. Fans of Rankin&#x2019;s excellent, just-ended John Rebus series will likely be disappointed by this offering. While Rankin builds some suspense with a dogged DI named Ransome and a Hell&#x2019;s Angel named Hate&#x2014;the tension remains perfectly bearable. Mackenzie seems unfazed by the threat of jail time, characters are glib when they ought to be scared, and the tepid ending takes a page, if you will, right out of Scooby-Doo: in danger, Mackenzie buys time by explaining the plot, while the villains assist him by bloviating about how painful everyone&#x2019;s death will be when eventually inflicted. Finally, in a novel where art forgery plays a starring role, the details of the forgery are too sketchy. We can&#x2019;t help but wonder if Rankin is like his character here: having retired Rebus, he&#x2019;s still looking for a new thrill to equal the old one. --Keir Graff</p><h2>In Celebration of the Seasons: Recipes from a Monastery Kitchen</h2><p>More than 150 recipes, including soups, appetizers, entrees, salads and desserts -- all arranged by season.

It provides an understanding hand to hold as you look for answers to questions you never expected to ask: What happened to the person I lost? What happens to that love? Is there any way to connect to the joy of that relationship again? With complete honesty, warmth, and humor, Goodman describes how her seemingly irrational yet relentless desire to maintain communication with her dead son enriched her life and led to one unwavering conclusion: Death is not an ending. It is another stage of life and love that is available to anyone willing to experience it. Goodman addresses the sometimes controversial subject of after death communication with candor and an open heart and mind.</p><p>It's never comfortable to read, or even think, about grief. And <i>Love Never Dies</i> is many things--eloquent, sweet, touching, and powerful--but it is definitely not an easy read. Sandy Goodman has taken brave steps past K�bler-Ross's work (<i>On Death and Dying</i>), and here she challenges us to open ourselves to a different set of stages that she labels numbness, unrelenting pain, searching, and reinventing. She writes with comforting openness about pretending that she was progressing through the standard stages, was "getting over" the death of her son, and was searching for a more clearly defined faith. She also is frank about the real need to continue acknowledging birthdays as well as the anniversary of death, and provides a few specific suggestions for friends to help those going through grief, such as asking, "How are you really doing since [he] died," instead of merely, "How are you?" <p> Each chapter closes with a short message in bold print, written from the point of view of Goodman's dead son, Jason. She clarifies in the introduction that this is not channeling or automatic writing, merely her best guess as to what he might have to add to her own thoughts. Regardless of your point of view on these additions, it is clear that Jason is continually present to his family. </p><p> While the particular focus of the book relates to parental grief, much of it is both useful and appropriate for anyone dealing with a powerful loss. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>Sandy Goodman lives with her husband in central Wyoming.

This generation has just entered, or will soon be entering the work force. And they have no idea how to invest, save, or handle their money. <br><br>Young people today come out of school having had little or no formal education on the basics of money management. Many have large debts from student loans looming over their heads. And many feel confused and powerless when their pricey educations don't translate into high paying jobs. They feel that their $30,000-$40,000 salary is too meager to bother with investing, and they constantly fear that there will be "too much month left at the end of their money." <br><br>Douglas R. Andrew has shown the parents of this generation a different pathway to financial freedom. Now Doug and his sons, Emron and Aaron - both of whom are in their mid-20s - show the under-30 crowd how they can break from traditional 401k investment plans and instead can find a better way by investing in real estate, budgeting effectively, avoiding unnecessary taxes and using life insurance to create tax-free income. <br><br>With the principles outlined in <em>Millionaire by Thirty</em>, recent graduates will be earning enough interest on their savings to meet their basic living expenses by the time they're 30. And by the time they're 35, their investments will be earning more money than they are, guaranteeing them a happy, wealthy future.</p><p>Douglas R. Andrew is the owner and president of Paramount Financial Services, Inc., a comprehensive personal and business financial planning firm. His sons, Emron and Aaron Andrew, have clients nationwide whom they advise for asset optimization, equity management, and wealth empowerment. Starting with annual incomes of $30,000 at the age of 22, they have used the strategies outlined in <em>Millionaire by Thirty</em> to each accumulate assets totaling over $1.5 million at the ages of 26 and 27.Measured writing and occasionally stiff narration don't reduce the homespun appeal of this helpful investment guide by a financial advisor and his two 20-something sons. With a humanitarian spirit and many helpful strategies, they show how young people with ordinary jobs can focus on the long-term and invest wisely enough to become millionaires at an early age. Their three pillars of wise investing (compound interest, tax minimization, and leveraged investing) and three investment criteria (liquidity, safety, rate of return) are only a few of the lists and categories used to keep listeners focused on big-picture principles. These and memorable recommendations that are easy to understand make this an outstanding resource for any 20-something you know and love.

She&#39;s also a popular speaker at Christian women&#39;s events. Elizabeth and her husband, Jim, are parents and grandparents, and have been active in ministry for more than 30 years.Aimee Lilly's voice has just the right amount of enthusiasm, warmth, and sensibility to make her a perfect choice to read George's time management plan for Christian women. George writes as though she is offering advice to a younger sister, adding endearments such as "beloved" and "dear one" throughout the work. Lilly seems to run with this, conveying a tone of familiarity, understanding, and a can-do attitude. While many of the ideas proposed would work only in the most traditional Christian families, George does have many good suggestions for setting priorities and remaining grounded in today's hectic world. Though the book is not for everyone, the tips could be a valuable help to any woman trying to make more time for prayer.

Fifty-seven years later, Robison left Grambling as the winningest coach in the history of college football. Initially a coach for a segregated society, Eddie Robinson has helped football transcend race in the America he loves and treasures. Yet institutionalized racial barriers kept Robinson a secret from white America for more than 25 years until Howard Cosell did an ABC special on Grambling in the late 1960s. Outside of the world of sport, white America still barely knows him. In the African-American community, he is very likely the best-known coach in America. He is surely the most beloved.<br><br>Never Before, Never Again chronicles Coach Robinson's life and his time at Grambling in vivid detail. He overcame all those things that might have predicted that it was not possible for the son of a sharecropper and a domestic worker to become a success. He got a master's degree, became the president of the American Football Coaches Association, and helping thousands of young boys become outstanding men. More than wins, they may be his greatest legacy.<br><br>But as much as Coach Robinson's memoir is about sports, it's a social history history as well. The book is a lens through which readers can see the challeges and turmoil of the civil rights movements from the perspective of a sports figure who worked the playing fields of a black campus while caring deeply about the stakes and outcome of the struggle . This book places the hard-news events of the day in the time frame of the trails of Robinson's Grambling teams of that era. Also included are the thoughts of other coaches (both college and NFL) on Coach Robinson, as well as those of national leaders like Reverend Jesse Jackson, M.J. "Mike" Foster, the governor of Lousiana, and President Clinton.<br><br>Never Before, Never Again stands as lasting testimony to the work of a true American hero.<br></p><p>Grambling State's Eddie Robinson started coaching college football when FDR was in the White House and didn't stop until Bill Clinton's second term. Along the way, he racked up 408 victories, but his real legacy isn't in the stats. A black man coaching black athletes in the Deep South for 57 seasons, Robinson witnessed and took part in amazing changes in society and in his sport, battling prejudice and hatred to earn respect for himself and opportunity for his players. <i>Never Before, Never Again</i> plays gamely in both those arenas--society and sport--because it has to; for Robinson they are one and the same.<p> "I never thought that schools like LSU and Alabama would integrate," he can admit, aware that great performances by black athletes competing at those schools played a big part in their integration. Yet, amidst the upheavals of the '60s, he also knew that doing his job wasn't just about coaching football. He learned to harness that anger at the criticism hurled his way from more militant quarters: "I wasn't going to go out and hurt somebody or let one of my own get hurt to disprove that I was an Uncle Tom." Robinson proved his talents year in and year out, winning not just games and championships, but respect and admiration. He also helped change the face of his game in college and beyond, sending more than 200 players to the NFL, including Super Bowl MVP Doug Williams. The candor of <i>Never Before, Never Again</i> is as refreshing as it is revealing; the story itself is pure inspiration. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>Praise for Coach Eddie Robinson:<p> "They call me the greatest. I know that the greatest football coach who ever stepped on the field is Coach Eddie Robinson. I have admired what he has done in turning boys into men in addition to becoming the winningest coach in the history of the game. He is a credit to his sport as well as a credit to humanity." --Muhammad Ali</p><p> "Nobody has ever done or will do what Eddie Robinson has done for this game. Our profession will never be able to repay Eddie Robinson for what he has done for the country and the profession of football." - Joe Paterno, Penn State University</p><p> "Because of what this "great" man (and I never use the term freely because few men can truly qualify) has accomplished in his lifetime every true American who believes in this great nation should be proud to read this story of "The Coach" and his beautiful and wonderful companion of 58 years, Doris. Smile, laugh, even cry, for you will enjoy every minute of the life of "The Greatest American" I have ever known!" - From the Foreword by George M. Steinbrenner, III</p><p> "<i>Never Before, Never Again</i> shows why Eddie Robinson has always been a hero in my eyes. Without question, Eddie Robinson is an ambassador for our people, not only African-Americans but all the American people. That's why I have such respect for Coach Robinson." - From the Afterword by Reverend Jesse Jackson</p><p> "Coach Eddie Robinson's name alone invokes in me immediate thoughts of his character, his wisdom, his love for student-athletes, and of course, his winning. Eddie Robinson is the epitome of humanity, courage, and patriotism. This book is a treasure for those who want their own life to count, and for the yet-future coaches and athletes who will draw strength and inspiration from a life so giving and well-lived." --Grant Teaff, Executive Director, The American Football Coaches Association</p></p><h2>The Rip-Off</h2><p>1st Vintage Crime/Black Lizard Ed trade paperback new book In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p>(1906 - 1977) James Meyers Thompson was born in Anadarko, Oklahoma. He began writing fiction at a very young age, selling his first story to <i>True Detective</i> when he was only fourteen. Thompson eventually wrote twenty-nine novels, all but three of which were published as paperback originals. Thompson also wrote two screenplays (for the Stanley Kubrick films &#x201c;The Killing&#x201d; and &#x201c;Paths of Glory&#x201d;). An outstanding crime writer, the world of his fiction is rife with violence and corruption. In examining the underbelly of human experience and American society in particular, Thompson&#x2019;s work at its best is both philosophical and experimental. Several of his novels have been filmed by American and French directors, resulting in classic noir including <b>The Killer Inside Me</b> (1952), <b>After Dark My Sweet</b> (1955), and <b>The Grifters</b> (1963).Thompson throws readers a curve in these two titles. Written in his signature tough-guy style, The Kill-Off (1957) is about a murder before it actually happens as protagonist Luane Devore is waiting to be knocked off by any number of likely assassins from among her friends and relatives. Published posthumously in 1985, The Rip-Off has a comedic tilt as Britt Rainstar's life is turned upside down after meeting the luscious Manuela Aloe. Thompson is always a fun ride. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Theory Of Literature: New Revised Edition</h2><p>A classic of criticism that examines the nature, function, form, and contents of literature.

Drinker wrote in her diary nearly continuously between 1758 and 1807, from two years before her marriage to the night before her last illness. The extraordinary span and sustained quality of the journal make it a rewarding document for a multitude of historical purposes.<br>Published in its entirety in 1991, the diary is now accessible to a wider audience in this abridged edition. Focusing on different stages of Drinker's personal development within the context of her family, this edition of the journal highlights four critical phases of her life cycle: youth and courtship, wife and mother, in years of crisis, and grandmother and Grand Mother. Although Drinker's education and affluence distinguished her from most women, the pattern of her life was typical of other women in eighteenth-century North America.<br>Informative annotation accompanies the text, and a biographical directory helps the reader to identify the many people who entered the world of Elizabeth Drinker.</p><p>Abridged ed.Elaine Forman Crane is Professor of History at Fordham University.</p><h2>Eric Kroll&#39;s Fetish Girls</h2><p>The American King of Fetishism <p>As a teenager, New York photographer Eric Kroll was excited by women in bondage or high heels � la Betty Page - and he still is.

I wanted a different light to shoot by. I went from a studio to shooting in a classic Victorian mansion. I&#39;m still a fetishist. I live with my muse, Gwen, and my children. I made about a dozen more videos and two books of photo sexual narratives involving Gwen entitled &#34;&#34;The Transformations of Gwen&#34;&#34; Volumes 1 and 2 (NBM Publishing). I am more interested in capturing intimate sexual &#39;play&#39; than before. The players have to be in heels, hose must be within frame, rubber nearby, with a hint of leather. It is the game of pleasure that I seek on film. Don&#39;t come naked to me. Come with attitude and kneel or stand above me. My audience is particular, born as it were, from Fetish Girls.&#34;&#34;</p>
